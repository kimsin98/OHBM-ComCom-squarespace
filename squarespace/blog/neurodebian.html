<p style="text-align:left;"><span><font color="#2a2a2a">Neuroimagers face an ocean of software tools that have the potential to make research transparent, sharable, and collaborative. Open science is on the horizon, and we could use some instructions on how to ride the open software wave. We couldn’t think of better software surfers than Michael Hanke and Yaroslav Halchenko, the creators of NeuroDebian. NeuroDebian is a curated ecosystem of neuroscience research software that runs on virtually everything. It originally started as a personal convenience tool in 2005, then went above and beyond its initial purpose, finally transforming into a widely-used and globally accessible platform.</font></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: What is NeuroDebian? Can you briefly explain it in layman's terms?</font></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight:700"><font color="#2a2a2a">Michael:</font></span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700"> </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">NeuroDebian was started almost 12 years ago, and was originally intended to provide correct software ecosystems. This is not only about shipping software to another computer, but a full system integration effort, so that independently developed software can work together in one system. NeuroDebian is basically a front for the Debian system, a decentralized and democratic effort of individuals working together to develop </span><a href="https://www.debian.org/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">the universal operating system</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. Think of it as a neuroscience capable operating system.</span></span></p>

It’s your cellphone with the app store, but it is not just the cellphone. It can be your laptop, PC or even a computing cluster. NeuroDebian and Debian provide this whole turn-key platform where you have an app store offering accessible software. All that software is already available for you, and a </span><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">dockerfile</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> or </span><a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">singularity</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> file can describe which ones to install. I think we cannot get more layman than that.</span></span></p>
<p><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:700">Michael: </span></font><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Did you say lame?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: NeuroDebian was not initially intended to be a global project. Tell us about how it grew into something bigger. </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><span style="font-weight:700">Yaroslav: </span>It started from scratching our own itch. We were doing our PhDs (or so we thought), and needed software to analyze data. We were Debian users already, and thought it would be cool if we could share our work: I packaged and maintained PyEPL, Michael did the same for FSL. We soon realized that there are more interests besides those two software tools. The catalyst was us joining the Jim Haxby Lab at Dartmouth. In a frenzied week in 2009, we packaged lots of potentially useful software. Then we established NeuroDebian, as it is known now. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: The spirit of free software is at the heart of NeuroDebian. It is a community driven development. How do you manage all those remote contributions? </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><span style="font-weight:700">Michael: </span>Yes, it is a global enterprise with many people contributing to it. But it is also, given its size, complexity and the amount of effort that goes into it, by far not international enough. For the amount of impact it has, it is actually a fragile enterprise. It has taken up considerable time and effort from researchers, even though the outcomes are not going straight into their PhD or research projects. Some software is more difficult to integrate than others. I don’t want to single any out, it just symbolises the whole situation and reflects the world we are in. Tools are kept behind closed doors until the people who developed them are properly credited.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><span style="font-weight:700">Yaroslav:</span> In comparison to where we were 12 years ago, we are now in a very different ecosystem. In getting there we used many of the concepts of open science and open software, such as continuous integration. Without that we’d be fixing bugs for every release. To ensure scalability, we encourage people to test their software, and even though this is not directly related to NeuroDebian per se, it ensures that software remains working on all systems. Another angle is that we share the responsibility. Michael packages something and I package something else, and then we share it so that anyone can benefit. The same goes for the teams within Debian (<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience">Debian-Science</a>) which we are also part of, and we maintain many packages together with those teams. We are not duplicating anyone’s effort. Other team members do their part and we often just borrow relevant neuroscience research packages and backport them for all Debian and Ubuntu users. Everyone is happy at the end of the day. Once again, it would be impossible if these were done in an independent fashion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: We hear about backporting. Is there a simple explanation for that? </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><span style="font-weight:700">​Yaroslav: </span>It takes a lot of effort to stabilize a release. That’s why the most stable Debian releases are usually the most outdated ones. This takes us back to Michael's comment about integration. When you put together software that is supposed to work together and then you attempt to stabilize it, eventually it remains stable over years. But research software has different needs. Researchers want to adapt new methods as quickly as possible. So, we take a stable Debian release and put new software versions in it. If we were to upload fresh tools to the unstable versions of Debian and wait until it becomes stable, it would take too long. This is the point where backporting comes in handy. It allows us to provide the most up-to-date software for all Debian and Debian derivatives, such as Ubuntu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">​AK: The name gives the impression that NeuroDebian is exclusive to the Debian OS. What about researchers used to OSX or Windows?</font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Yaroslav: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">We saw cases where people installed NeuroDebian on a virtual machine and after a while realized that they keep their OSX or Windows in the background all the time. So they installed Debian as dual-boot at the beginning and then wiped out anything else but Debian. There are other people who prefer to keep their original OS, because they need to use Microsoft Word. You can even run NeuroDebian within NeuroDebian.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: How is NeuroDebian maintained, where do the resources come from? </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="font-weight:700"><font color="#2a2a2a">Yaroslav:</font> </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">First it was our advisors. They allowed us to pursue this instead of our research. Some projects provide a small proportion of the funds needed to support NeuroDebian. But overall, NeuroDebian never received dedicated funds as a project. Whenever we apply, there is always one reviewer who says  “this effort matches Friston’s brilliancy of SPM” , and another who says “it is just some packaging, who cares”. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="font-weight:700"><font color="#2a2a2a">Michael: </font></span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I think we should name drop here. Yaroslav’s advisor was Stephen Hanson, who paid for this for years. My advisor was Stefan Pollmann, who did the same. After many unsuccessful applications, I stopped thinking about grants. Once we wrote a grant where we had 40 letters of support, but reviewers questioned the letters’ legitimacy. Next time we gave them twice as much, and that was also not enough. The best comment we received was ‘this doesn’t fix any disease, try elsewhere’. Most of the stuff we do cannot be tied to a single purpose. We are not the ones achieving it, we are enablers.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: We know custom installations of neuroscience research software can be painful. How easy is it to install them on NeuroDebian? </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Michael: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">It really depends on the complexity. You can have a really easy installation after downloading gigabytes of binaries that are pre-compiled for your system. If you want to install it again, you need to repeat the same steps. However in Debian, you have all the benefits of automatic upgrades. You would say “I use 150 software packages on this computer and I need to download and update all of them”. The more complex the system you use for your research, the greater the benefit of using a package manager system. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Yaroslav: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do you remember how difficult it is to install apps on your phone and maintain them? Not really! You just click, install them and they keep updating themselves automatically. This is primarily the same thing. Once your research software is installed you don’t need to think about where it comes from or how to update it. It just gets done and it works. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Michael: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Most people do not have administrative privileges on the hardware or the execution environments they use. Think about institutional clusters, think about workstations managed by someone else. In general, you need to call a system administrator and say which software you need installed. If you are on Debian, this only takes a few minutes. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><font color="#2a2a2a">AK: Most of the processing pipelines have a heterogeneous working environment with strict version dependencies. This is a serious threat for sustainability and reproducibility. How does NeuroDebian tackle this problem?  </font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Yaroslav:</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> A while ago, we created the NeuroDebian virtual appliance.

So you can recreate any Debian system you used in the past. We now do the same thing for NeuroDebian, although it is not fully public yet. This way, if you know that your software environment previously existed, you can re-establish it. It can also be used to validate the compatibility of your current system. We are pursuing this through the </span><a href="http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">ReproNim</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> project that can track versioning for even more crowded environments.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">​Michael:</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> You can keep using the script-based generated environment for as long as the underlying components exist. But in my experience, many claims of strict version dependencies are convenient excuses, but not real dependencies. Often it’s because somebody spent time manually assessing whether a software works as it should. That’s why they have that strict dependency, because they are not willing to go through that manual effort again.  In this case you are following a trust and hope model. No manual validation that is done on one machine scales to the other. Remember the paper showing</span><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038234"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)"> surprising differences in Free Surfer outputs</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> depending on the execution environment. You need high level tests for machine based verification so you can make sure that when you ship it to your users, it will work.

Open Science is not just doing science in a different way, it is the only way. All the excuses people had not to be fully transparent while spending public money for public research can be justified only by the technology limitations of the past. Today, we have surpassed those limitations. There is no point in keeping things secret. In addition, open source software development is the role model of open science. If you look at collaborative coding platforms like GitHub, you will see how low the threshold is for people to work together. The same will happen with open science, and things will become much more interesting and faster. </span></span></p>
