Gathering around tables, they stare at screens full of code, colorful text on a black background reminiscent of the code rain from the Matrix trilogy. Welcome to the control room of computational neuroscience! There is a reason why we call these neuroscientists ‘hackers’: they are </span></font><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">hacking to provide their colleagues  with accessible and powerful computational methods, or whatever means necessary, to crack the brain code. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">While trying to wrap my head around a way to explain the hackathon concept, I received an email by the </span><a href="http://www.fsf.org"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Free Software Foundation</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. It was an article by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Richard Matthew Stallman </span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">(‘rms’, considered by many to be the founding father of free software), explaining why hackathons should insist on developing free software. Such a lucky coincidence! Its opening lines were an eloquent description of the core mandate of hackathons:  “</span><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">Hackathons are an accepted method of giving community support to digital development projects. The community invites developers to join an event which offers an encouraging atmosphere, some useful resources, and the opportunity to work on useful projects.</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">” </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">OHBM Hackathons are organized by the </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3712"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (SIG), to achieve open sharing of ideas, data and tools between members of the OHBM community. In line with this mission, most projects in the hackathon aimed to improve analyses using free software libraries, releasing computational tools from the grip of proprietary software. For example, the AFNI Love project team built some of the most complex tools for Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_Functional_NeuroImages"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">AFNI</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">) into </span><a href="http://nipy.org/packages/nipype/index.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">nipype</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, an open-source Python project that aims to piece together algorithms from different packages into a single processing workflow. Managing to complete the project in only three days, this team demonstrated how the hackathon could bring people together to create useful new software, while also creating networking opportunities to connect novice and more experienced hackers, and planting the seeds of long-term, more ambitious projects. This is well summarized in the following tweet by Pierre Bellec, the chair of the OHBM Open Science SIG:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Pierre Bellec has put his heart and soul into the hackathon for years, and this dedication has clearly paid off. In discussing this year’s hackathon he told me: “Vancouver, that was beyond anything I’ve seen so far. Because, there, the hackathon had matured and taken on a life of its own. I feel like the previous hackathons were more like experiments, a recipe in the making. This time around the community jumped right in, everybody knew their part and seamlessly integrated the new members. By the end of the event, there was no telling the newcomers from the veterans.” Indeed, the level of productivity and communication in Vancouver was off the charts. After talking to Pierre, I spotted my friend Gregory Kiar, whom I first met at the hackathon. The most exciting thing to him was that so many new people were coming into the hackathon and, in a short period of time, achieving something remarkable. He mentioned how five projects were merged into one, as captured by another member of the hackathon organizing committee, Kirstie Whitaker:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The OHBM hackathon is designed to encourage collaboration and sharing of knowledge, rather than competition. This drives productivity and enables people to learn and develop quickly. During three days of hacking, the teams worked hard to develop software that could make computational neuroscientists’ lives easier. Most importantly, several small and somewhat redundant individual projects will merge into an open source collaborative effort, with much higher chance of long term success and reaching high code quality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">For instance, Mindcontrol, Abide, Deep-qc, Clowder and Freesurfer teams united their considerable hacking prowess under one banner: </span><a href="https://clowdcontrol.github.io/#/title"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Clowdcontrol</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. This new user friendly web platform can run demanding “deep learning” analyses in large and distributed networks of computers - the metaphorical cloud. The PyNets project team developed a Python toolbox that automates functional and diffusion-weighted MRI network analysis. By leveraging existing open source tools, they were able to assemble an impressive array of methods, that has kept growing since.</span></p>

Team TOAST took urgent action to provide OHBM participants with a search engine that works better than the official OHBM mobile event </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coreapps.android.followme.ohbm2017&amp;hl=en_GB"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">app</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> in finding posters/events at the conference. </span><a href="https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2017/wiki#bloodart"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Team BloodArt</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> prepared an art piece on brain vasculature entitled “Deep Blood” by integrating elements from immunohistochemistry, high-resolution 7 Tesla MRI images and machine learning algorithms, which was exhibited at the main conference.</span></span></p>

As long as you don’t let the jargon intimidate you, the Hackathon will  help you  gain useful skills on the fly, make new connections and broaden your academic horizon. As one of the participants noted during the wrap-up, the OHBM hackathon is helping to put back the collaboration and the fun at the heart of science, right where it belongs. Hope to see you at the OHBM Hackathon 2018 in Singapore!</span></span></p>
