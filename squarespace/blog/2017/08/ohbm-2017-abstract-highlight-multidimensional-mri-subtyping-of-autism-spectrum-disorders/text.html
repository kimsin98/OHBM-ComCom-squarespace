Previous research suggests that there is likely no single autism type, but rather a collection of different subtypes of autism that may each be associated with different biological causes and behavioral symptoms. In our project, we built a novel approach to subgroup a larger population with a diagnosis of autism based on multiple MRI measures of cortical morphology. We could indeed identify multiple subgroups with different imaging features and functional network anomalies. Using a machine learning framework, we furthermore show that information about subtype was useful in predicting the severity of behavioral symptoms in individual cases, possibly suggesting clinical utility of the proposed framework.</span></p>

This may challenge current diagnostic procedures and impede person-specific therapy. We hypothesized that a main source of the inconsistency across previous findings may relate to heterogeneity across the autism spectrum itself. Our study presented at this OHBM conference addressed the heterogeneity of structural brain phenotypes as well as their potential implication in behavior and brain function in autism spectrum.</span></p>

By integrating advanced MRI features of vertical and horizontal cortical organization (such as cortical thickness, cortical interface blurring, surface area, and geodesic distance), our framework may offer a biologically meaningful way to group subtypes of autism phenotypes which are characterized by specific brain morphology and behavioral symptoms. Finally, our study makes use of both unsupervised as well as supervised learning techniques to address these high dimensional datasets, and can thereby derive predictors of symptom severity at the individual subject level.</span></p>

This would collectively result in a comprehensive and multidimensional characterization of the autism spectrum. Furthermore, our work may provide a useful framework to address the heterogeneity often found in other neurodevelopmental disorders.  </span></p>
