<p style="display: block">This month OHBM launched <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/"><span style="color: #15c">its new website</span></a>. This long-standing project dates back to 2014, when a membership-needs survey revealed that OHBM members wanted more online resources for educational advancement and career opportunities. There was also a desire for outlets in which to promote new influential research and controversies in human brain mapping and engage our members outside of the annual meeting - issues now addressed through the <a href="../index.html"><span style="color: #15c">OHBM blog</span></a>, the <a href="../media.html"><span style="color: #15c">non-member media</span></a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OHBM"><span style="color: #15c">social media accounts</span></a>. For the website, members wanted this new functionality in a clear, intuitive layout that was more responsive to dynamic content and the changing needs of the brain mapping community. Thus, the story of a new website began.</p>
<p>The challenge to design and implement the new website was taken on by the website team within the OHBM Communications Committee. This 8-person-strong team (Fernando Barrios, Roselyne Chauvin, Christophe Phillips, Jessica Turner, Stephanie McGuire, Jae Gullings) led by Jeanette Mumford and Lisa Nickerson, integrated feedback from the survey with the set of existing webpages, updated content, and re-organized them by type for easier user navigation. They also considered how to merge the website with the new educational material provided by the <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM On Demand</span></a> service, a platform that hosts past OHBM courses and talks. These now openly available videos and slides allow anyone interested to watch keynote lectures from <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/3232/video_presentations/33868"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Susan Bookheimer</span></a>, <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/3232/video_presentations/38477"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Tim Behrens</span></a>, and other high profile brain mappers, as well as many educational courses, such as <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/5158/sections/7777"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">diffusion MRI</span></a>, <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/5158/sections/7756"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">advanced fMRI analyses</span></a> and hundreds of other topics covering state-of-the-art methodologies and clinical applications of neuroimaging.</p>
<p>The website team developed ways to integrate and present various streams of OHBM news that emerge throughout the year, with front-page links to the <a href="../index.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM blog</span></a> and <a href="../media.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">lay media</span></a>. They created a new <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/member_directory/feSearchForm.cfm?directory_id=2&amp;pageid=3843&amp;showTitle=1&amp;widgetPreview=0&amp;page_version="><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">searchable career center</span></a>, allowing job seekers to <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/ams/publicLogin.cfm?nextpage=/i4a/careerHub/index.cfm?action=signupUserRedirect"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">post their CVs</span></a> &amp; search jobs, and employers to <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/ams/publicLogin.cfm?nextpage=/i4a/careerHub/index.cfm?action=signupCompanyRedirect"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">post new positions</span></a> and search CVs. For important announcements, the team created a “<a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">what’s happening</span></a>” section on the front page, letting users know about abstract submission deadlines, the <a href="ohbm-replication-award-qa-with-chris-gorgolewski.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Replication</span></a> and <a href="ohbm-young-investigator-2017-lucina-uddin.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Young Investigator</span></a> awards and other OHBM initiatives. The new format also made it easier to locate and view the dedicated webpages for <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">COBIDAS</span></a>, <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3633"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">special interest groups</span></a> and <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3632"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM chapters</span></a>. Critically, the website now displays more easily on mobile phones and tablets - providing all this info in a way that suits our busier lives.</p>
<p>Last, our new website includes a dedicated space for each year’s <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3821"><span style="color: #15c">annual meeting website</span></a>, creating consistency and better organization  of information. You can find out answers to frequently-asked questions, <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3841"><span style="color: #15c">register for the hackathon</span></a>, see <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3838"><span style="color: #15c">featured speakers</span></a> when they are announced and check out <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3831"><span style="color: #15c">the sponsors and exhibitors</span></a>. Our advice: have a few clicks around the website, give us your <a href="mailto:+info@humanbrainmapping.org"><span style="color: #15c">feedback</span></a>, and most of all, enjoy your new hub for all things brain mapping!</p>
