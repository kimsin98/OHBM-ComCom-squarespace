<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The human brain is a complex organ that continues to fascinate many researchers the world over. Brain researchers (including those involved in bench work using microscopy to those analysing brain images with supercomputers and complex algorithms) demonstrate a range of expertise, from neuroanatomy to diverse cognitive processes. The Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) is aimed at bringing together brain researchers and providing them with a platform to discuss new science, foster collaborations and improve our understanding of the brain.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the past twenty-two years, OHBM has achieved this goal by presenting new facets of human brain mapping at each conference. The growing presence and influence of social media compelled OHBM to foray into the blogosphere, where we present greater insight into the workings of OHBM to researchers at all levels. Our offerings also highlight recent scientific discoveries and increase your acquaintance with contributions of researchers world over. Since its inception in April 2016, we asked you (our blog visitors) to indicate your area of expertise, in order to get a sense of who we are ultimately writing for. We found a diverse, wide-ranging span of responses representative of the many, many areas of specialization that represent human brain mapping. Most of our blog visitors were academics working on modelling and analysis, imaging methods, and higher cognitive functions (See figure). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">These trends are generally consistent with the nature of posts featured on the blog. However, we have not yet had time to cover some areas such as brain stimulation and applications in psychology. Moreover, human brain mapping is a multi-disciplinary field that includes scientists in basic biology attempting to understand the microstructure of the brain as well as psychologists and clinicians exploring brain functioning and changes in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As we begin our second year, we will continue bringing you the type of articles that have made our blog so successful such as </span><a href="karl-friston-enabler-during-the-week-theorist-on-the-weekend-part-1.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">our interview with Karl Friston</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, </span><a href="keep-calm-and-scan-on.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">response to Eklund’s paper on cluster failure</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (which was covered in the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/opinion/sunday/do-you-believe-in-god-or-is-that-a-software-glitch.html?_r=0"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">New York Times</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), and </span><a href="imaging-brain-activity-in-real-time.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">recent post on MEG</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, yet also find ways to reach readers seeking information on basic biologic and physiologic aspects of the brain.
