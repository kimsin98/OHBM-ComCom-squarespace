The SIG has three working groups, with each providing a unique focus for shared action:</span><ol><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Annual meeting working group</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> oversees the organization of OHBM conference and advises the Council on minimizing the environmental impact and making it more sustainable. </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Neuroimaging research pipelines working group</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> tries to evaluate the environmental costs of these research pipelines and develop tools to optimize them.</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Education and outreach working group</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> aims to develop educational resources for the neuroimaging community and related organizations to effectively communicate the information that they need.</span>​</li></ol> <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The SIG aims to be a supportive forum where people within the neuroimaging community and beyond can work together to help preserve our planet for the future.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">At OHBM 2021, SEA-SIG participated in numerous activities. These included:</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Through these climate-science-related activities, there are several main takeaways for all OHBM members. First, we learned that virtual conferences drastically reduce the carbon footprints of conference-goers. This is mainly because long-haul and intercontinental flights generate a lot of carbon emissions per passenger. Many also suggested that having hybrid in-person-virtual or virtual conferences in alternate years may help reduce carbon footprints of conference travel while reaching more colleagues and scientists who could not attend conferences due to various inclusivity and accessibility reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The </span><a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Open Science Room</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> forum, </span><a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/paneldiscussions/1"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Saving time and resources: Open-science and sustainability</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, was the most highly attended out of all the SEA-SIG activities and garnered over a hundred attendees. Our panelists discussed many knowns, unknowns, and possibilities about sustainable neuroimaging pipelines and how we could tackle this global issue together. We discussed the relationship between sustainable neuroimaging, open science, and climate change, and how they reinforce one another. Throughout the various activities, many agreed that we need to work together, not just as individuals, but also as a team, institution, or organization, to reduce our impact on the environment. </span>​</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Building on this theme, some ideas discussed in the symposium session include collaborating with professionals from other disciplines to tackle neuroimaging and sustainability problems, incorporating sustainability in teaching, and being more responsible as scientists in our research and our institutions. We also discussed how the current practices in the field impact the Earth and strategies we could uphold to reduce these impacts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="2">Various activities SEA-SIG participated in during the conference, including a symposium, social lounge, and roundtable.</font></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the first steps anyone could take should they be interested in tackling climate change is to join the activities of SEA-SIG. SEA-SIG is looking for talented individuals who have a heart for sustainability to join the three working groups. Furthermore, SEA-SIG will also soon be holding elections for Chair-Elect, Secretary-Elect, and Treasurer-Elect. </span>​</p>
