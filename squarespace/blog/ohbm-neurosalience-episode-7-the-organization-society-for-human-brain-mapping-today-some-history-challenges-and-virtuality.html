<font size="3">In this podcast we discuss some of the history and evolution of OHBM. We also talk about some of the challenges that it has faced in recent years with world events causing a last minute change in venue three times. We talk about the improvements in this year’s virtual meeting as well as the growth in the engagement of younger members of OHBM with all the chapters and SIGs. </font>

From 2009 to 2011 he was a post-doc in the Department of Neurology at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig then a group leader of the Neuroanatomy and Connectivity group at Max Planck, Leipzig from 2011-2017. He received the 2018 OHBM Young Investigator (now called Early Career) award and received the Otto Hahn Award in 2010. He has been a pioneer in fMRI connectivity methods and has recently produced novel and penetrating work elucidating the organizational gradient that spans between sensorimotor and trans-modal areas. </p>
