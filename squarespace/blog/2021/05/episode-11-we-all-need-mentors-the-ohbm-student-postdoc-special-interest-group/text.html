In this episode Peter Bandettini meets Carolina Makowski, Michele Veldsman and Alex Fornito to discuss the <a href="http://ohbmtrainees.com"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Student–Postdoc special interest group (SIG)</span></a>, with particular emphasis on their mentoring scheme and meeting-related workshops. Carolina is a current member of the SIG, Michele previously served as its Chair, and Alex has been an active mentor to several junior OHBM members over the years through this group. They discuss the mentorship program, the workshops at the meeting, what good mentorship is, and why it’s needed more than ever, as the stresses and demands of students and postdocs increases within an ever more demanding professional climate.
