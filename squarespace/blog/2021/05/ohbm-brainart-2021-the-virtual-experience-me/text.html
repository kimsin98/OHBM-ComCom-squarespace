<strong><span class="sqsrte-large">We’ve freshened up!</span></strong></p>
<p>After two years of existence as an official OHBM Special Interest Group (SIG), the BrainArt SIG has now proudly released its <a href="https://ohbm-brainart.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">website</span></a>, created by <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/anastasiabrovkin"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Anastasia Brovkin</span></a> and <a href="https://github.com/dllussier"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Désirée Lussier</span></a>, following brainstorming by all SIG officials. You can browse through all previous competitions and exhibits, as well as submit your pieces for the 2021 edition! </p>
<p>You can find out more about our SIG by checking out previous posts on <a href="brain-art-sig-evolution-and-new-perspective-for-ohbm-2019.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">how we came of age</span></a> and <a href="verba-volant-scripta-manent-ars-permanent.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">how we consolidated our role within OHBM</span></a>, but also about our <a href="the-interplay-between-neuroscience-and-art.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">prehistory</span></a> and <a href="ohbm-2017-the-dream-catchers.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">history</span></a>. And we highly recommend having a listen to <a href="episode-8-art-and-the-brain-the-ohbm-brainart-special-interest-group-sig.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Neurosalience episode #8</span></a>, where we had a blast chatting with Peter Bandettini.</p>

<strong>We’re preparing a great BrainArt Exhibit for you!</strong></p>
<p>The BrainArt SIG is busy preparing the annual brainart exhibit for OHBM 2021 meeting attendees. The SIG has confirmed artists from all over the world and...well, we don’t want to spoil your surprise but you are in for a treat! We will offer a broad representation of artists ranging from full time scientists, full time artists, and all creative souls in-between. Our 2021 theme is <span style="font-weight: 700">“Big Data &amp; Me”.</span> We wish to celebrate the achievements of Big Data neuroimaging projects, while acknowledging the suffering of individuals affected with brain disorders. <span style="font-weight: 700">Honoring the trees as well as the forest.</span></p>
<p>First, we will dive into <span style="font-weight: 700">large datasets</span> while keeping in focus <span style="font-weight: 700">inclusivity, diversity, and the representation of populations. </span></p>
<p>Second, from big N to small N, what about the personal suffering of individuals? After all, we started the field with case study. We will explore the dimension of brain illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and autism in a single subject looking glass. </p>
<p>Finally, will host the pioneering ideas linking different levels of observation, as interpreted by artists who are encouraged to explore the reciprocal interactions between Big Data research and personalized treatment, i.e. breaking of the barrier between research findings and treatment. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>We’re ready for your artworks!</strong></p>
<p>So don’t wait another minute! Please go explore our website and the archives and get inspired. It’s time to create and participate in the <span style="font-weight: 700">BrainArt competition 2021 - now open to accept your masterpieces</span>. On the website you will find a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-uGM5Ad3CKYbWj9vMaC-U_xWLQAkYu8E5DPS_0cwsyZKajg/viewform"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">form to submit</span></a> your art for one of the following five award categories: </p>
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 700">Big Data &amp; Me</span> - a new category in celebration of this year’s BrainArt Exhibition</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 700">Beautiful Mistake</span> - anything resulting from a artifact, bug, or failed attempt <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"> </span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 700">Pictures to Prose</span> - brainart poem or brainart short story<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"> </span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 700">Still Images -</span>  any brainart image</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 700">Videos and Animations</span> - any brainart audio-visual or animated contribution</li>
</ol>
<p>This competition highlights an ongoing aim of the BrainArt SIG, which is to foster the dialog between artists and scientists, blurring the line between Arts and Science. We believe that the exchange of ideas and tools between these two disciplines encourages the development of novel approaches to scientific data visualization, and promotes the exploration of different perspectives on human brain structures and functions. <span style="font-weight: 700">Researchers, scientists, and everyone in between: you are all encouraged to submit your original work(s)!</span> There are no limits to the number of submissions per participant, and both team and single-person entries are welcomed. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 700">Submission Deadline is 11:59 PM CDT, Saturday, June 6, 2021 and the</span> award notification will take place during the Annual Meeting. For additional details, <a href="https://ohbm-brainart.github.io/competition.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">please check out our website</span></a>.</p>
<p>This year, following the success of our campaign to provide a logo for <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4022"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Aperture</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 700">there is also a very special 6th category added to the BrainArt competition:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: 700">Logo for OHBM SEA SIG</span>  - We’re calling all artists and designers to help visualize a logo concept for the recently founded OHBM <a href="https://ohbm-environment.org"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Sustainability and Environment Action (SEA) Special Interest Group</span></a>. We created a placeholder logo upon our founding last year (see <a href="https://ohbm-environment.org"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">our website</span></a>), which was closely based on the main OHBM logo. However, the time is now right to create a dedicated SIG logo. If you’d like to create a logo for consideration, please review the following details:</li>
</ul>
<p> 

</p>
<ol>
<li>The logo can include the SIG name, or not.</li>

<li>The logo should try to reflect the mission of the SIG outlined here: <a href="https://ohbm-environment.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">https://ohbm-environment.org/</span></a> </li>

<li>Logo design should be clean and striking, and can be in colour or black and white.</li>

<li>Logo submissions should be in png format, 100 dpi, and no larger than 8 x10 inches. The winning logo will be requested at higher resolution: 300 dpi and in tiff format.    </li>

<li>The logo will be used in the SIG online platforms and communications (e.g. SIG website, twitter account, talk slides), virtual or otherwise </li>
</ol>
<p>

We hope that this teaser and the exploration of the new OHBM BrainArt SIG website will encourage you to participate or enjoy this year's BrainArt Competition &amp; Exhibit.</p>
