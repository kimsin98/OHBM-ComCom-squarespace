OHBM has a new podcast:  Neurosalience!  You can listen to it in your car, while out walking, or just in the ever-present home office. Through Neurosalience, you’ll learn about recent advances and current controversies in brain mapping. The host for the podcast, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/peter-bandettini.shtml"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Peter Bandettini</span></a>, has lined up a stellar cast of interviewees ranging from brain scientists to hardware vendors and health professionals.  This includes finding out about publication biases affecting gender and racial minority groups with Dani Bassett, network neuroimaging in neurological populations from Michael Fox, circuit based neuromodulation from Catie Chang and much more. Get all of this insight through your favourite podcast apps, including <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1d5umtPYtQJksxI2Rto8ZT"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Spotify</span></a>, apple podcasts, <a href="https://anchor.fm/ohbm"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">anchor</span></a> and Google Podcasts.</p>
<p style="display: block">We launch with a brief introduction to the podcast, a fireside chat between Peter and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachael-Stickland"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Rachael Stickland</span></a> (one of the OHBM Communication Committee producers for the show). Then the first full episode explores Aperture, the new open-access publishing platform powered by the OHBM.

Aperture, a new open access publishing platform for neuroimaging research</span></span></p>
<p>Peter Bandettini introduces Aperture, a new open access publishing platform for neuroimaging research. Peter is joined by one of the co-founders, <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/jean-baptiste-poline-phd"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Jean-Baptiste Poline</span></a>, along with  the new Aperture Editor In Chief, <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/sophia/research/researchers/white-tonya"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Tonya White</span></a>, and the journal manager, <a href="https://gmpartners.org/kay-vanda/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Kay Vanda</span></a>. Together, they discuss the motive, history, steps for creation, and current status of Aperture. It was created with the strong support of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping, and aims to be a peer-reviewed platform for publishing not only papers, but also various other types of research objects that often do not find space in conventional journals, including data, educational tutorials and code. While there is still work to be done to be fully up and running, many insights into this process are shared and discussed. </p>
