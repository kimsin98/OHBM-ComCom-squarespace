Together, they discuss the motive, history, steps for creation, and current status of Aperture. It was created with the strong support of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping, and aims to be a peer-reviewed platform for publishing not only papers, but also various other types of research objects that often do not find space in conventional journals, including data, educational tutorials and code. While there is still work to be done to be fully up and running, many insights into this process are shared and discussed. </span></span><br>
