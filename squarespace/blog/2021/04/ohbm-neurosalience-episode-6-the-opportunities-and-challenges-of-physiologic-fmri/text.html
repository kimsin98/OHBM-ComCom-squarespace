This week’s podcast is centered on physiologic fMRI. Generally, when people think of fMRI, they think of a way to map neuronal function, however there is so much information about neurovascular physiology in the signal. Many researchers who use fMRI may not realize all of the potentially untapped information—and confounds!—in the fMRI time series. Dr Jean Chen and Dr Molly Bright each run research groups that focus on this information in complementary ways. Both use physiologic manipulations and an array of acquisition methods to probe and characterize details of the hemodynamic response, though their two research programs focus on different aspects of the haemodynamic response function. In this podcast, they highlight the importance of physiologic fMRI for the field. They also consider the challenges facing women in male-dominated research fields and how the life of women scientists might be improved.

She completed her postdoctoral work on multimodal MRI of brain aging at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and Harvard Medical School (2011), then joined The University of Toronto Medical Biophysics Program as faculty. She is a Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute and Tier II Canada Research Chair in Neuroimaging of Aging. <br>

She then moved to Nottingham as an independent Anne McLaren Fellow, to develop ultra-high-field MR imaging methods for studying cerebral physiology in neurological diseases at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre.<br>
