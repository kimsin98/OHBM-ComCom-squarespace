<font size="3">In this week’s podcast, you’ll hear about clinical applications of resting-state fMRI from Dr Michael Fox. You’ll hear some of the highlights of his research, from the beginnings at Wash U, including his early work on resting-state fMRI and the issue of global signal regression, to his more recent pioneering work on lesion network mapping. Through this, you’ll find out about how lesions can impact behavior through their effects on functional networks. This approach is a promising inroad of fMRI towards clinical utility. </font>

Fox, MD, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 700">,</span> is the founding Director of the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. He is also the inaugural Raymond D. Adams Distinguished Chair of Neurology and the Kaye Family Research Director of Brain Stimulation. He completed a degree in Electrical Engineering at Ohio State University, an MD and PhD at Washington University in St. Louis, and Neurology Residency and Movement Disorders Fellowship at Mass General Brigham. Clinically, he specializes in the use of invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Dr. Fox’s research focuses on developing new and improved treatments for brain disease by understanding brain circuits and the effects of neuromodulation. <br>
