In that time, 20 Research Objects have been submitted and reviewed, and four of those have already been accepted for publication. More Research Objects are currently being revised and reviewed and we look forward to announcing more published Research Objects in the near future.   </span><br>With this launch, we wanted to highlight the first Aperture Neuro publication, share some of the exciting features of the new platform, review the types of Research Objects authors can submit, and discuss the ways OHBM members can support this exciting initiative. </p>

<p>In this inaugural publication for Aperture Neuro, Kruper et al., in their Research Object titled “Evaluating the reliability of human brain white matter tractometry,” show that diffusion MRI based tractometry, a technique used to characterize white matter pathways in the brain, is a reliable method. The authors also provide a framework for future researchers to help ensure the reliability of computational analysis pipelines in neuroimaging.

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 700"><span class="sqsrte-large">What to Expect with Aperture Neuro’s New Publishing Platform</span></span></p>
<p>Aperture Neuro’s new <a href="https://apertureneuro.cloud68.co/login"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">publishing platform</span></a> is 100% open-source, and you can access the platform with your ORCID ID. <br>If you are unsure of your Orcid ID or need to register for one, you can easily do this by following the <span style="font-weight: 700">“Forgot your Password or ID,” </span>and <span style="font-weight: 700">“Register Now”</span> prompts after clicking “Login.” </p>
<p>Authors can submit various research objects and supplementary files, including links to preprints, jupyter notebooks, and Github repositories.</p>
<p>Authors will be able to submit their main manuscript via <span style="color: rgb(47, 67, 79)">docx</span> and take advantage of Wax 2, a premium word processor within the platform that can be used to revise submissions within the platform. <br>Currently, the platform is limited to word files. However, authors often request more flexibility in editing and revising pdf, latex, and other non-docx files. As such, Aperture Neuro are exploring options for editing, copyediting, and publishing these in the future. <br>Authors will also be able to log in at any time to check on the status of their submission.</p>
<p>Editors, reviewers, and authors will be able to use a chat feature in the platform to discuss submissions in real-time. Confidential conversations between editors and reviewers are also possible. <br>Aperture Neuro’s new platform offers reviewers the choice to sign their review or remain anonymous to the author. <br><span style="font-weight: 700">A new feature called “Shared Review” will also allow for reviewers who are paired together to view each other's comments and decisions.</span> Aperture Neuro is excited about the possibility of having reviewers team up to review Research Objects together such as software submissions. The Editorial Team will determine if a shared review is needed and will invite reviewers to collaborate. <br>If a reviewer is not part of a shared review, they will not see the comments or decision of fellow reviewers assigned to a Research Object.</p>
