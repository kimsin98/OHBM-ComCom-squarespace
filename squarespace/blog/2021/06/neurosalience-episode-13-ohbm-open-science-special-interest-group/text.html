In this episode of Neurosalience, Peter Bandettini meets the <a href="https://ossig.netlify.app/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS-SIG)</span></a>. Together they discuss the history of and the unique, important role the OS-SIG plays in OHBM. The group fosters open science not only by encouraging best practices and sharing data and code, but also by encouraging inclusivity in science and open- ended discussion in a supportive environment.

<p><a href="https://akinikolaidis.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight: 700">Aki Nikolaidis</span></a> - is chair of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group, and served on the Student Postdoc Special Interest Group from 2017-2019. He is a research scientist at the Center for the Developing Brain at the Child Mind Institute in New York City. His research focuses on using advanced statistical methods to better understand psychopathology, brain organization, and cognitive performance. Aki's work in neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning has been featured in over 20 peer-reviewed publications. </p>
<p><a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/personomics/sample-page/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight: 700">Janine Bijsterbosch</span></a> is chair- elect of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group. She is Assistant Professor in the Computational Imaging section of the Department of Radiology at Washington University in St Louis. The Personomics Lab headed by Dr. <span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 6)">Bijs</span>terbosch aims to understand how brain connectivity patterns differ from one person to the next, by studying the “personalized connectome”. Using open data resources such as the Human Connectome Project and UK Biobank, the Personomics Lab adopts cutting edge analysis techniques to study functional connectivity networks and their role in behavior, performance, mental state, disease risk, treatment response, and physiology. In addition, Dr. <span style="color: rgb(7, 7, 6)">Bijs</span>terbosch wrote a textbook on functional connectivity analyses, which was published by Oxford University Press in 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/johanna-bayer"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight: 700">Johanna Bayer</span></a> is secretary- elect of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group, treasurer elect of the OHBM Australia chapter and active member of the OHBM Sustainability and Environmental Group. This year is also her second year behind the scenes helping to organize the OHBM Brainhack.  Johanna, who is originally from Munich, Germany has a background in Psychology, Neuroscience and Computer science and was awarded the Melbourne Research Scholarship in 2018 to pursue her PhD at the University of Melbourne. Her PhD work is focusing on creating a normative model of the brain from neuroimaging data to study depression, and on a method to harmonize site-effects in large neuroimaging data sets. In addition to her passion for her work and for Open Science, Johanna also loves dancing, rock climbing, computer science and cats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katherine-Bottenhorn"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight: 700">Katie Bottenhorn</span></a> is the secretary of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group. She is a graduate student who is interested in how large-scale brain network topology varies both between- and within-individuals over the course of everyday life. She is especially interested in how hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptives contribute to this variability, and how this differs with respect to changes in sleep, exercise, and stress.</p>
<p><a href="https://i-am-mel-dev.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight: 700">Melvin Selim Atay</span></a> is the inclusivity officer of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group. He is working at the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey and his research focus is explainability of deep learning.
