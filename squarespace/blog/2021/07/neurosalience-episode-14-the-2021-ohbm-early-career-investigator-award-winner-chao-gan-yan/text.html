<p>Here Professor Peter Bandettini has a wide  ranging discussion with the 2021 Early Career Investigator Awardee, Chao-Gan Yan. They talk a bit about his career path, the highly impactful work he has been doing, as well as some of the most challenging issues in fMRI: dealing with motion, variability, finding biomarkers, and designing just the right packages that help the beginner and  expert alike. Chao-Gan gives some great advice to new investigators regarding what was important to him to get him where he is today. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 700">Dr. Chao-Gan Yan </span>is a professor at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IPCAS). He is the Director of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Center, the Director of International Big-Data Center for Depression Research, and the Principal Investigator of The R-fMRI Lab located at IPCAS. Before he joined the IPCAS in 2015, he worked as a Research Scientist at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University School of Medicine. </p>
<p>Dr. Yan received his Ph.D. degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University in 2011. His research mainly focuses on the resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) computational methodology, mechanisms of spontaneous brain activity, and their applications in depression. He has addressed fundamental methodological issues such as the impact of head motion, standardization, and multiple comparisons on the study of resting-state functional connectomics. He has also developed data processing and analysis toolbox for R-fMRI, DPABI, and DPARSF, the latter having been cited over 2000 times.</p>
