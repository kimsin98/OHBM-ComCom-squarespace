<p>Dr.  Hariri recently published an important paper on the test-retest reliability of common task-fMRI measures.

In this podcast Peter and Ahmad discuss the implications of this paper and how to address the challenges it presents and continue to move the field forward. This is an informative and positive discussion about how to collectively address these issues as a field.
