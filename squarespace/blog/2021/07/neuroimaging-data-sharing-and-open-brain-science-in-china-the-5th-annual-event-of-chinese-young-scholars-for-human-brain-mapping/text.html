Its sites include more than 180 member hospitals/research institutes across China. The collected data includes demographic information, clinical data, risk factors, neuropsychological tests, blood and urine biomarkers, multimodal MRI biomarkers, glucose mentalism, and amyloid deposition. The main aim of SILCODE is to estimate cognitive decline and establish statistical prediction models for the outcomes of subjective cognitive decline in elderly Chinese people.</span></p>

Since 2015, they have been conducting an imaging genetic cohort study of school children in Beijing. They aim to depict brain development during school years, review the mutual effects between brain development and school functions, and examine the interaction between genes and school experience, including learning to read, learning a foreign language, and sports or music extracurricular activities. As of May 24th of this year, they have scanned almost 800 children at baseline, more than 470 at follow-up 1, and more than 360 at follow-up 2. The follow-up is ongoing. Furthermore, based on the baseline data, </span><a href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/chn-pd"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">the Chinese pediatric brain templates</span></a><span style="color: rgb(59, 59, 59)"> (6-12 years old) were developed and released in 2019 . Since the end of 2016, a national imaging genetic cohort study of school children has been planned. This national study will be supported by the China brain initiative, planning to follow 30,00 aged 6 to 7 years old children for more than 10 years on their brain and behavior development across various urban and rural areas around China. Now, nearly 30 institutions have joined in this project.</span></p>

He proposed that localizing the seizure focus as well as its boundary can help plan intracranial EEG location and seizure focus resection, moreover, localizing the abnormal activity can help define the targets of focused brain stimulation such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. How to precisely locate the abnormal brain activity. There are some inclusion criteria of published papers for high-quality coordinate-based meta-analysis including voxel-level (not region-level) analysis, whole-brain (not partial brain) analysis. And the analytic methods in the region study should be very similar. The analytic methods of the existing meta-analysis papers of neuroimaging studies such as task-fMRI, VBM, PET are very similar. However, for rs-fMRI, the analytic methods vary a lot in most studies. So far, PD and AD/MCI are the most reproducible abnormal activity for a specific brain disorder. Finally, he proposed data sharing and multi-center data analysis are necessary. To locate the abnormal brain activity of brain disorders can guide focused brain stimulation. A small p-value may not increase reproducibility. It can provide a “gold” standard for computation studies to develop new analytic methods. Last, for a single-center study, he strongly encouraged individual maps or at least the t-map without any threshold should be published. </span></p>

This is a long-term lifespan developmental cohort on the human brain and mind. CCNP employs the accelerated longitudinal design to build a lifespan sample of 1,200 healthy people aged from 6 to 85 years old. It comprises three components. The first one is the developing stage (devCCNP), namely ‘Growing Up in China’. The second one is the standardizing stage (stdCCNP), which is also called 3R-BRAIN and designed for the measurement standardization. And the last one is the aging stage (ageCCNP). Furthermore, there will be 6000 pairs of twins across the same lifespan after the initial cohort is completed in the second ten-year phase of the CCNP. By now, the working team has completed two accelerated cohorts in Beijing and Chongqing. Using the CCNP big data, the team charted brain growth in tandem with brain templates at school age. They found that it is necessary to use each specific and affinity matched brain template in brain growth chart analysis. Recently, using the repeated resting-state functional data from CCNP, the team further revealed a developmental shift of cortical connectivity gradient across school ages. </span></p>
