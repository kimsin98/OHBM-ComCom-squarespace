<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">OHBM 2019 in Rome next June will mark twenty-five years since the first meeting in Paris. During that time the organization has evolved from an annual meeting of like-minded brain mappers to a society with multi-national chapter meetings hosted throughout the year, early-career researcher led special interest groups and open science resources. To celebrate what has been achieved during that time, we asked some of the founding members how they became interested in neuroimaging, how brain mapping has changed, about developments in funding and opportunities within their country and about their memories from OHBM meetings. </span></span></p>

We learned about Canada’s hugely impressive investment in neuroimaging, the incorporation of genetics and other sciences into the work presented at OHBM and the collegiate, youthful feel of the OHBM meetings themselves.</span></span></p>
