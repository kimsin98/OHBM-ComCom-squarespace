<p style="display: block"><a href="https://ohbm-aperture.github.io/"><span style="color: #15c">Aperture</span></a><span style="color: #0e101a">, OHBM’s exciting new open-access publishing platform, is on track for a June launch, just in time for the 2020 Annual Meeting. The Aperture Oversight Committee, consisting of Jean-Baptiste Poline, Peter Bandettini, Michael Breakspear, Nikola Stikov, David Kennedy, and Jessica Turner, has been hard at work finalizing a plan of operations that will help guide all of Aperture’s submission, editorial, and review processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">Aperture was created by and for members of the OHBM community to share and promote their research. Aperture is unique in that it offers a platform for publishing traditional papers, code, data, and data papers. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">The platform will operate as an open-access journal with a double-open Peer Review system. However, Peer Reviewers will have the option to opt-out of having their identity known to the author at any stage in the review process. Research will be published under a</span> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">. There are no submission fees, but authors will be asked to pay an Author Processing Charge upon acceptance for publication. We’ve worked to make our fees very competitive, and the fee is reduced for OHBM members. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">Recently, the platform put </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwdbXF2EBD6Aohw_bGTtCT91Y_uZiTOM/view"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">out a call for an Editor-in-Chief</span></a><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">. The selected candidate will serve as Aperture’s first Editor-in-Chief and will play a significant role in shaping the platform’s editorial and publishing policies. Any qualified individual is welcome to apply. If you know someone who would be a good fit, please help Aperture get the word out. For more information on the application requirements and to apply, please visit the </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/forms/index.cfm?id=145"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">online submission form</span></a><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">. The closing date for applications is Friday, May 1st. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">Opening up nominations for an Editor-in-Chief isn’t the only milestone Aperture has reached. We’ve also begun site testing with the platform developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">With all the progress made, Aperture’s development is well underway, and we hope to be ready for submissions in June for the virtual OHBM annual meeting. Stay tuned for information on Aperture’s submission guidelines and launch. </span></p>
