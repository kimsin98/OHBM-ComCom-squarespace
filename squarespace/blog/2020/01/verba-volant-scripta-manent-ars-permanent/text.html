<p>And here we are, January 2020! A new decade is starting, with end-of-the-year reflections giving way to wishes and resolutions for the future. As Chair and Secretary of the BrainArt <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3633"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Special Interest Group</span></a> (SIG), the youngest SIG within OHBM, we will here outline our inner structure to introduce you to our members, briefly cover our past endeavors, and finally sketch our plans for the coming year. Buckle up!</p>
<p>The coming of age of OHBM Brain &amp; Art initiatives <br>For us, 2019 has been the year of the transition from a rather informal group of aficionados, supported and sustained by the <a href="https://www.neurobureau.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Neurobureau</span></a>, to a structured team within our Society. Last year's meeting in Rome thus signed not only the 25th anniversary of our community get together, but also our graduation, so to speak [you can read more about our transition <a href="brain-art-sig-evolution-and-new-perspective-for-ohbm-2019.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a>].</p>
<p>For this second year of activity, our board consists of eight members:<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Chair</span>: <a href="http://www.amanbadhwar.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Aman Badhwar</span></a>, PhD, Université de Montréal<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Secretary</span> and<span style="font-weight: 700"> Diversity &amp; Inclusivity Committee Liaison</span>: <a href="https://valentina.borghesani.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Valentina Borghesani</span></a>, PhD, University of California San Francisco <br><span style="font-weight: 700">Art Exhibition Manager</span>:<a href="https://childmind.org/bio/ting-xu-phd/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> Ting Xu</span></a>, PhD,Child Mind Institute<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Treasurer</span>: <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/sridar-narayanan-phd"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Sridar Narayanan</span></a>, PhD, McConnell Brain Imaging Centre, McGill University<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Past Chair</span>: <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/alain-dagher-md"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Alain Dagher</span></a>, MD, McGill University<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Council liaison</span>: <a href="http://computational-neuroimaging-lab.org/index.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Cameron Craddock</span></a>, PhD,University of Texas at Austin<br><span style="font-weight: 700">Advisory committee</span>: <a href="https://www.neuroconnlab.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Daniel Margulies</span></a>, PhD, ICM - CNRS, &amp; <a href="https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Pierre Bellec</span></a>, PhD, Université de Montréal</p>

<p>1. Chair-elect<br>2. Secretary-elect<br>3. Art Competition &amp; Onsite Exhibit Manager-elect<br>4. Social Media &amp; Communications Manager-elect<br>Feel free to reach out to our current members to know more about what each position would entail. <br>​</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Ars Cerebri - the 2019 Exhibit &amp; Competition in Rome</font></strong><br>Most art historians would agree that the Ancient Romans had a very peculiar approach to the Arts: artistic expressions had to be somewhat useful, purposeful. They could be means of celebration (arco di trionfo), or expression of devotion (statues in temples). Never something aesthetically pleasing for pleasure itself. The second key aspect of the Art in Ancient Rome was its stylistic eclecticism: elements and themes were  constantly borrowed from other mediterranean cultures such as the Greeks, Etruscans, and Egyptians.</p>
<p>Is our community only using (visual) Arts to improve visualization of our neuroimaging findings? No, not really. Or at least not in our view of a symbiotic and mutually beneficial exchange. We believe that Scientists can improve how results are represented and distributed, but also that Artists can be inspired by them. Ultimately, both paths allow society at large to better digest scientific discoveries and their implications. Crucial in this regard is to respect the talent and expertise of both sides. </p>
<p>Like the Romans, our Society is definitely open in spirit, with OHBM striving to promote open science with <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3962"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">awards</span></a>, our sister <a href="https://ossig.netlify.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OpenScience SIG</span></a>, and the new open publishing platform, <a href="https://ohbm-aperture.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Aperture</span></a> (for which we helped selecti the new logo - spoiler alert: it’s wonderful!).</p>
<p>Our exhibit and Competition during OHBM 2019, <span style="font-weight: 700">Ars Cerebri</span>, aspired to embody this message. Because we all know that while words only spoken will fly away, words put into writing will remain, and words turned into Art will live in perpetuity. Here is a taste of what we offered in Rome, but you can also enjoy the full catalogue of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/156jKT7ud8VCV8EPfBjN-TOMQS0kl1ams/view"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Ars Cerebri</span></a> and check out all pieces submitted on the dedicated <a href="https://www.neurobureau.org/galleries/brain-art-competition-2019-2/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">gallery</span></a>!</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">NeuroDiversity - the 2020 Exhibit &amp; Competition in Montreal</font></strong><br>For OHBM 2020, our exhibit theme will be NeuroDiversity, developed along three axes. First, we will invite selected artists to present their takes on neurodiversity. These works will range from giving underrepresented groups in neuroscience a voice, to the idea that some neurological differences should be seen as non-pathological forms of human variation. All our abilities and faculties range along a continuum and we all just represent one dot in a wide, diverse, spectrum.<br>In a complementary fashion, we will be showcasing art pieces by neurodiverse populations, for which Art can be a means of communication, an instrument for therapy, or a source of solace and pleasure. From neurodegenerative diseases to epilepsy, various communities have been contacted and will take part in the exhibit.   <br>​<br>Finally, we will include pieces reflecting the (above-and-beyond-neuro) diversity within the OHBM community. Our Society houses scientists from all over the world and we want to celebrate the geographical, ethical and cultural richness this brings us. <br>To this end, we encourage all members of OHBM to<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"> </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fZD2Qc5mM8t9Tn5ZG3pIa2yX7nFKRUB7?usp=sharing"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">download from this folder their favorite brain outline</span></a>, and fill it with whichever (colored) pattern they like and feel represented by. Personalized postcards should then be sent to ohbm[dot]brainart[at]gmail[dot]com. We will be collecting them and displaying them during the conference in Montreal as an artistic collaborative collage.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the competition will be held online relying on the support of the Neurobureau. Submissions will be accepted starting in February until mid-June (stay tuned to our social media for prompt updates!). Awards will be given for the following categories:</p>

<p>Our last words are to acknowledge all the artists and OHBM members who, through the years, supported our endeavors.</p>
