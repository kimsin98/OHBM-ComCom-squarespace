<p>As we are getting ready to announce the 2020 OHBM Replication Award winner, here is a brief flashback to 2019 and our interview with Richard Dinga from the Department of Psychiatry at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands. Richard led the effort to replicate a<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4246"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> study</span></a> published in Nature Medicine in 2017 about the relationship between resting state connectivity and the neurophysiological subtypes of depression. </p>
<p> The Nature Medicine publication has been cited over 400 times according to Google Scholar, yet Richard and colleagues found the methodology of the original paper to not be as reliable as the paper suggested.The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6543446/"><span style="color: #15c">replication study</span></a> was published in NeuroImage Clinical and the associated data and analysis are available as supplementary materials on the publisher's website. Watch the video clip from our interview, and stay tuned for the 2020 Replication Award announcement!</p>
