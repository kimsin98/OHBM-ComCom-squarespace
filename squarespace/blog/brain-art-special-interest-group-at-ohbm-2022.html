We aim to encourage artistic approaches and perspectives to understanding human brain function, facilitate the development of novel approaches for the visualization of scientific data, and provide a model of interaction between disciplines while enhancing the public outreach of OHBM. We achieve these goals through annual activities such as the Brain-Art Exhibition and Competition at the OHBM conference.</span></span></p>
