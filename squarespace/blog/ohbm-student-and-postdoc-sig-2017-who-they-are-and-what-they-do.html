<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(59, 58, 60)">OHBM is open to brain mappers of all ages and career stages, and the students and postdocs are a vital part of the society. Despite strong representation by PIs, there remains a need for trainees to have their own platform where they could discuss and disseminate information specifically relevant to them, such as job opportunities, funding, scholarships, and awards. The </span><a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/StudentSection/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group (SIG)</span></a><span style="color:rgb(59, 58, 60)"> was set up to achieve these aims, while also creating the opportunity to interact in-person during the famous </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/OHBMStudentandPostdocSection/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1613615975318407"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Monday Night Social</span></a><span style="color:rgb(59, 58, 60)"> at the annual OHBM meeting. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(59, 58, 60)">In 2017, however, there is more to the SIG’s efforts than the above mentioned activities. The SIG has a new initiative on mentorship to help prepare trainees to transition to early-career researchers; that includes a symposium and the launch of an online international mentoring forum. The symposium is slated to include a panel discussion, in addition to talks by academics that will help provide career direction to human brain mapping postdocs and students. The new online mentoring forum will pair students, postdocs, and researchers in online mentoring relationships that cross the globe; these mentoring pairs will have the opportunity to meet in person during the annual meeting. Together, these initiatives offer information about possible career paths, and organize information seekers and givers into a cohesive unit. Such information will breed confidence in early-career researchers and help them become the leaders of future research initiatives. To do all this and more, we have put together a team of excellent students and postdocs to lead the SIG. These committee members come from varied backgrounds in their research, and are representative of the diversity of our community at-large. </span></span></p>
