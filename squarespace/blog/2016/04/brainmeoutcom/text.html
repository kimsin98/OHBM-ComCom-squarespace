<p style="text-align: justify">A local student group in Geneva has set up headquarters at <a href="http://cercle-des-bains-2.webflow.io/" target="_blank">Le Cercle des Bains</a> as THE place for students, post-docs, and OHBM members to meet every night after the scientific sessions of the 2016 Annual Meeting, and to share ideas and comments about their experiences. Attendees of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OHBM2016?src=hash" target="_blank">#OHBM2016</a> also have access to a new website developed by the local student group.  Find more information on the headquarters, resources, and various social activities, including their own party on Tuesday night, at <a href="http://Brainmeout.com" target="_blank">Brainmeout.com</a>. Thank you to our local Geneva student group for creating this cool site, and for planning such a wonderful welcome to our members!​</p>
