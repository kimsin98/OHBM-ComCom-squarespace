<p style="display: block"><em>Excerpt from OHBM Communications/Media Team article on Huff Post Science:</em><br>At the end of June, I found myself through running the streets of Geneva with two other brain mappers--all three of us sweaty from trying to catch the bus. Even though I live in New Jersey and am used to muggy weather in the summer, I couldn’t help but recognize how humid it was. We nearly missed the bus that would take us to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) to talk about how the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org">Organization for Human Brain Mapping</a> (OHBM) and WHO can work together to improve international public health through brain research. Thankfully, we made it on board and were able to get on with the important work of the day.</p>
<p style="display: block">On July 1st, 2016, I joined a diverse group of behavioral neurologists, radiologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and public health professionals from around the world gathered in that building for a joint meeting between the WHO and OHBM. The WHO building opened its doors in 1966 and carries the stamp of time. Interestingly, we were all there to discuss something that could not have even been imagined in 1966 - applications of brain research to matters of public health. <em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ekaterina-dobryakova/improving-public-health-t_b_12594890.html" target="_blank">Read more.</a></em></p>
