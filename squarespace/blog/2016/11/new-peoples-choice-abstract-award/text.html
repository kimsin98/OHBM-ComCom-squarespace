<p> The Organization of Human Brain Mapping is pleased to announce a <strong>new</strong> OHBM People’s Choice Abstract Award to be given to one team presenting their research during the 2017 OHBM Annual Meeting poster sessions in Vancouver. <span style="font-size: 1em; background-color: transparent;">The goal of this award is to allow meeting attendees to highlight their favorite presentation and to bring the most popular abstract into the OHBM spotlight.  Annual Meeting attendees will vote on their favorite (using in-app voting), and the team who receives the most votes from registered attendees will be awarded the People’s Choice Abstract Award. The first author of the winning team will receive the cash prize of $500 at OHBM 2017 Closing Ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS </strong><br>OHBM Annual Meeting attendees vote for their favorite abstract using the OHBM mobile app.  Each attendee can vote for up to two abstracts, one during each of the two-day blocks (one vote during Monday/Tuesday session and one vote during Wednesday/Thursday session). Any duplicate votes from users or votes from unregistered users will be removed. The abstract with the highest number of votes from unique voters will be announced at the Closing Ceremony. </p>
<p>All abstracts presented at the OHBM Annual Meeting, as posters or oral presentations, are eligible for this award.  <em>No shows are disqualified from consideration. </em></p>
