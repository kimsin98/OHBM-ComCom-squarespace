<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span>The Communications Committee of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping is beginning its second year and is looking for additional members. This is a great opportunity to become part of a vibrant and thriving committee that produces posts for the OHBM blog, articles for HuffPost Science, conducts video and email interviews with top brain researchers and uses social media to communicate that work to the brain mapping community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span>The formation of this Committee was approved by the OHBM Council in 2015 with the primary goal of increasing the visibility and impact of members’ work within the OHBM community and to extend it to a broader audience. The Communications Committee is now seeking a few additional volunteers for a three year term. If you have experience writing, editing copy, or in social media, video, graphic design or website maintenance, we hope you’ll consider becoming part of the Communications Committee. OHBM seeks to include a diversity of members from a wide range of geographic locations, different experience levels, and encourages women and minorities to apply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span>We welcome you to participate in this very important OHBM initiative. If interested, please complete the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SGQFKJX"><span>Call for Volunteers online form</span></a> no later than Monday, November 28.  To apply you must be a current member of OHBM (visit <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/"><span>www.humanbrainmapping.org</span></a> to renew your membership or become a member). Submitted applications will be presented to the Communications Committee leadership for consideration and selection.</span></p>
