<p><a href="../contributors.html">BY: OHBM BLOG TEAM </a><br>At the recent OHBM Annual Meeting in Geneva, we encountered an interesting variety of ways that people both chronicled their personal experience at the meeting and engaged with the material of sessions attended. Many people vigorously took notes, others live-tweeted or posted photographs of slides and presenters online, but one of the most unique examples we discovered was a meeting attendee who was live-sketching session speakers and posting them to instagram.</p>
<p>The live-sketching artist, <a href="http://blog.donders.ru.nl/?page_id=4343&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">Roselyne Chauvin</a>, is a PhD Candidate and founder of <a href="http://cognijunior.org" target="_blank">Cogni' Junior</a> and lives in the Netherlands.  When asked about how she started doing this type of drawing, Chauvin replied "Well, I do a lot of popularization of science for children (<a href="http://cognijunior.org/">cognijunior.org</a>) so a lot of non-scientists/teachers are following me on social media. I thought live-sketching the conference was a nice way to show that researcher meetings are not boring and, in general, to fill the gap between the general public and us. In the meantime, I discovered that it helps me to keep focus between all those amazing talks and to remember more of them. It's also saying to scientists that can't make it and want to catch some glimpses of it via twitter: you are not forgotten. Not everyone can fly to Geneva, right?"</p>
<p>The images below are from keynote lectures, educational courses, oral sessions and symposia. Think you know some of these speakers? Recognize material you learned in an OHBM session? See how many sketches you can identify. </p>
