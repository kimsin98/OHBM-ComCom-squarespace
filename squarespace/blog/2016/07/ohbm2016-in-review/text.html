<p>During the annual OHBM meeting in Geneva I had fun making word clouds from the twitter feed of the hashtag #OHBM2016. Attendants could see the word clouds in between every presentation, and I think it made the welcome screen look pretty cool (you can find them on the @OHBM_members channel and on the OHBM facebook page). In case you thought some information was missing, that is simply because it was either not that frequently discussed on Twitter or<a href="http://www.wordclouds.com/"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">http://www.wordclouds.com/</span></a> did not show it (not all words appear depending on design and size). There was no censoring, and you can blame me if something was not to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">The exciting stuff</span><br>The most discussed lectures were those of <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3686"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Tim Behrens and Fernando Lopes da Silva</span></a>, closely followed by the talk from <a href="http://gael-varoquaux.info/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Gael Varoquaux</span></a>. The main topics that engaged attendees were connectivity analyses, machine learning, power analyses, BIDS and yes, Brexit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><u>Connectivity analyses</u><br>Thomas Yeo aptly summarized the current state of connectivity analyses on <a href="ohbm-2016-symposia-on-brain-connectivity.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">the OHBM blog</span></a> so no need to talk more about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><u>Machine learning</u><br>Machine learning is increasingly used in neuroimaging applications these days and Gael Varoquaux had lots of comments about his talk: '<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/crossvalidation-to-assess-decoder-performance-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Cross-validation to assess decoder performance: the good, the bad, and the ugly</span></a>'. In this talk he shows that leave one out strategies are biased and that N-folds cross validation, providing we keep the data structure, works much better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><u>Power analyses</u><br>I am really glad that use of power analyses is now at the forefront of neuroimagers’ discussions. During Sunday’s reproducibility workshop I discussed and presented two of the main tools used to carry out power analyses on full maps: <a href="http://fmripower.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">fMRIpower </span></a>and <a href="http://www.neuropowertools.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">neuropower</span></a>. These tools were then presented by <a href="http://mumford.fmripower.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Jeanette Mumford</span></a> (creator of fMRIpower) and <a href="https://psychology.stanford.edu/node/3999"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Joke Durnez</span></a> (creator of neuropower) in the<a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3712"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> Open Science SIG</span></a> room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><u>BIDS</u><br>Another favorite topic of mine: data sharing. <a href="http://bids.neuroimaging.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">BIDS</span></a>, or to give it its full name - Brain Imaging Data Structure - is driven by <a href="http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/team/chris-gorgolewski/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Chris Gorgolewski</span></a>, and describes how to structure and store your data in an easily shareable way. It provides advice on how to name files and how to create simple metadata text files (tsv and json). Using BIDS doesn’t require programming knowledge, and does substantially improve data sharing, by allowing machines to read data easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">The controversies</span><br>A paper from <a href="http://www.umu.se/sok/english/staff-directory?languageId=1&amp;uid=anek0025"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Anders Eklund</span></a> et al. about failure to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) using cluster size was<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/06/27/1602413113.full"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> recently published in PNAS</span></a> and elicited many comments, not just online but also from the floor. The paper suggests that cluster size correction may significantly inflate false-positives, addresses the extremely important issue of controlling FWER, and is a must read along with the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08199"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">comment</span></a> from Glass Brain awardee <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Friston/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Karl Friston</span></a> and <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=GFLAN55"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Guillaume Flandin</span></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block">From our community, gender imbalance and diversity was frequently discussed and added to the #GenderAvenger hashtag. It was often commented that committee members and awardees were predominantly white males from wealthy countries. The Organization is well aware of this and has actively sought to reflect the geographic diversity of our membership as well as to balance the number of male and female session and keynote speakers. Council takes this feedback, of the need to do more, seriously and is actively at work to further address these issues, and push for all aspects of OHBM to become as diverse as the members it represents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">Top 5 twitter users </span><br>During the conference, the OHBM and OHBM_SciNews accounts retweeted posts from or with twitter users mentioned. Thanks to the top 5: @kirstie_j, @NKriegeskorte, @pierre_vanmedge, @ChrisFiloG, @ten_photos.</p>
