<p>BY KEVIN WEINER<br>New OHBM Communications Committee article on HuffPost Science:Â <br>"As a scientific conference approaches, I always think back to my first science fair: I stood next to my homemade presentation of graphs and tables glued to a poster board positioned next to hundreds of others made by fellow elementary school students. An overweight Paisan from rural New Jersey, I was more looking forward to my post-presentation reward of cannoli from my favorite bakery in South Philly than I was to standing for hours on end answering questions from the judges.</p>
<p>Conferences these days are pretty similar to the science fairs from decades ago, just on a grander scale with better technology. For example, every year the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/" title="">OHBM</a>) brings together thousands of scientists who work with brain imaging data from around the world to share hot off the press findings that they just published or are preparing to publish. This year, 4,391 presentations will be on hand in Geneva for our annual conference." <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-s-weiner/from-cannoli-in-south-phi_b_10710306.html" title="">Read more</a></em></p>
