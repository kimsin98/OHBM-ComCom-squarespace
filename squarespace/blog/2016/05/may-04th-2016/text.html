<p style="text-align: justify">Given the growing <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3475.html" target="_blank">concerns</a> about the reproducibility of published research, OHBM created the Committee on Best Practices In Data Analysis and Sharing (<a href="https://cobidas.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">COBIDAS</a>) in 2014. The committeeâ€™s subsequent white paper describes best practices of data analysis and sharing in the brain mapping community. After extensive feedback, the whitepaper has been revised to reflect this broader input. The brain mapping community (including both members and non-members of OHBM) must now <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3668" target="_blank">vote whether or not to support the report as the official best practice document of the OHBM</a>. The voting closes on <span style="font-weight: 700">May 12th, 2016</span>. We strongly encourage everyone to read and understand the importance of this work, and to voice your opinion with your vote. </p>
