<p style="text-align:justify;display:block;">We've just launched a series of articles on the Huffington Post. Unlike traditional ‘hot-off-the-press’ articles written by science journalists, these posts are written by the brain mappers themselves. As such, they cover not only current topics, but also foundational information that sometimes lies forgotten in dusty textbooks. The posts cover a range of topics - anything from what it would be like to walk along the cortical ribbon, to similarities between brain maps in you and in the astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson. They are fun, entertaining and under 800 words! Find the first article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-s-weiner/so-you-want-to-shake-hand_b_9835256.html?utm_hp_ref=brain">here</a>, and stay tuned for more over the coming weeks.</p>
