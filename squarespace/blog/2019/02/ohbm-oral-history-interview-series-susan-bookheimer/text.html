<p>In this second installment of the OHBM Oral History series we had the chance to speak to Professor Susan Bookheimer. Susan is a Clinical Neuropsychologist and Professor-in-residence at UCLA. She has played a leading role in our understanding of the brain basis of language, and pioneered the use of functional MRI and PET in clinical samples. Her recent work has explored the causes of social communication deficits in children with Autism. </p>
<p>Susan has been a significant contributor to OHBM throughout its history having taken on the role of meetings liaison (2002-03), Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board (2015-16) and Chair (2012-13). We found out about her early clinical work using functional imaging, her excitement about big data and how she overcame a bout of laryngitis to give a talk at the first OHBM meeting in Paris. </p>
