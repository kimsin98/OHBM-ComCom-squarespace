<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Early career researchers in different parts of the world face similar challenges, but not everyone has the same access to mentoring and career development resources. While online mentoring programmes, such as the OHBM </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.14320"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">International Online Mentoring Programme</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, are available, it is hard to cover the needs of the whole population of early career researchers in the natural sciences. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In order to tackle this issue within the OHBM Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group, we are developing a set of advice relevant to early career researchers in the natural sciences. The aim of this project is to empower early career researchers to positively influence their future career opportunities on a daily basis - regardless of the circumstances. The main points which we aim to cover are the following:</span></span><ul><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking charge of your career development by goal setting and making oneâ€™s own opportunities</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Managing your time properly</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Tips on taking care of yourself and surrounding yourself with positivity</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Recognizing and addressing bottlenecks in your projects</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Growing your network</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Mentoring and being mentored</span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Staying vigilant to opportunities outside science and keeping several doors open</span></span></li></ul></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The project will take the form of a full-length manuscript. The draft working paper has been posted under the link <a href="https://osf.io/53yrv/" target="_blank">https://osf.io/53yrv/</a>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">We would, however, like to further develop the manuscript before submitting this work for peer review. Therefore, to provide advice that can be generalizable to a wide variety of situations, demographics, and countries, we are seeking contributions from the OHBM community. <strong>We would like to welcome everyone willing to participate to join us and discuss this subject on the associated Google group: </strong></span><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/effective-self-management-for-ecrs" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/effective-self-management-for-ecrs</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">We look forward to your contributions. The manuscript is dedicated to early career researchers but we welcome the expertise and experience of seniors researchers on this topic as well. We hope the group endeavour will not only make for a better manuscript but also serve as a platform where early career researchers can give each other support and advice, and make new friends! Depending on the traffic, the Google group might be sustained after the final form of the manuscript is formed. The official starting date of the Google group is </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Monday, January 14th 2019</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, and we close collecting contributions on </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Thursday, February 28th 2019</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Active participation in the Google group will be interpreted as an academic collaboration. Therefore, we will bring together feedback received through the group, invite the significant contributors to co-author this work and reupload the working paper as a preprint with a new, extended list of authors. Invitation will be determined on the basis of: (1) constructive comments / additions to the manuscript and (2) being active and helpful to other members of the Google group. This material will be subsequently submitted for peer review. </span></span></p>

We hope to meet you soon and chat about careers together!</span></span></p>
