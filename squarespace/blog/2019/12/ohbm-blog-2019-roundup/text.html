<p><a href="../contributors.html"><span style="color: #2cb9f6"> (Lead editor)</span></a><br>The OHBM blog is now entering its fifth year. In that time it’s moved from primarily an interview-based format to embrace a diverse range of educational and entertaining posts. In 2019 this culminated in the introduction of the popular ‘How to’ series. This leveraged the rich content of <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">previous OHBM lectures </span></a>to teach novices, intermediates and experts about setting up and analysing<a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-resting-state-fmri-analysis.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> resting-state fMRI </span></a>and <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-diffusion-mri.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">diffusion MRI</span></a> studies, and using <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-machine-learning-in-neuroimaging.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0175fa">machine learning in neuroimaging</span></a>. Spearheaded by <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/lippi/374227"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Ilona Lipp</span></a>, our Chair Elect for the Communications Committee, these painstakingly crafted posts offer one of the best freely available resources for those wanting to get to grips with these techniques. We also managed to shine the spotlight on neuroimaging efforts in <a href="large-scale-neuroimaging-projects-in-china.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">China </span></a>and <a href="https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/human-brain-mapping-in-iran-talking-to-the-trainees"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Iran</span></a>, and plan to continue highlighting brain mapping across the globe throughout the ‘roaring 20s’. Finally, my personal highlight from 2019 was <a href="ohbm-oral-history-interview-series-bruce-rosen.html">to interview Bruce Rosen</a><span style="color: #15c">. </span><span style="color: #2a2a2a">He offered not only d</span>eep insight and historical perspectives of fMRI but did so with good humour. Looking forward to more next year.</p>

<p>Although I've contributed to the blog before, this was my first official year on the comms team. I'm happy to have spent the year focussed on open science efforts in our own community, such as the <a href="whats-next-for-the-ohbm-open-science-room.html">OHBM open science room</a> and <a href="aperture-ohbm-community-survey.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">the Aperture survey results</span></a>. Now I'm looking forward to a new year (and decade) of open, inclusive, and exciting brain science here on the OHBM blog!</p>

<p>My main contributions in 2019 were about Open Science (OS) initiatives, engaging the public as well as other science communities. So it was an honour to work with Teodora Stoica to narrate short fairy tale about <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/introducing-registered-reports-a-new-way-to-make-science-robust/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Registered Reports for the Scientific American</span></a>. It was also a great experience t 12o work with other OS enthusiasts on a blog post about our <a href="a-fruitful-rendevous-at-sips-neuroimagers-meet-study-preregistration-advocates.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">study preregistration hackathon</span></a>, held at the last meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) in Rotterdam. For 2020 I look forward to writing more about the clinical relevance of neuroimaging.</p>

<p>2019 was not only a fun but also a very educational year of blogging for me. The posts that I have been working on essentially aim to gather and summarize experience and advice from the very smart people in our field on various topics. This year we covered keeping a <a href="can-you-have-it-all-a-story-about-work-life-balance-in-academia.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">healthy work-life balance</span></a>, how to <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-machine-learning-in-neuroimaging.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">apply machine learning in neuroimaging</span></a>, hot to carry out highly clinically applicable neuroimaging (<a href="ohbm-2019-keynote-interviews-gil-rabinovici.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Interview with Gil Rabinovici</span></a>), how to teach MRI stats (<a href="archives/11-2019.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Interview with Jeanette Mumford</span></a>) and <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-diffusion-mri.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">how to do diffusion MRI</span></a>. Stay tuned and get ready for more in 2020!</p>
<h4><a href="../contributors.html">JEAN CHEN</a></h4>
<p>In my final year as part of the OHBM Blog Team, I wanted the chance to tackle a topic close to my heart --- <a href="can-you-have-it-all-a-story-about-work-life-balance-in-academia.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">work-life balance in academia</span></a>. Fortunately, we had enthusiastic participation from scientists around the globe, volunteering their experiences to guide a up-and-coming generation of young scientists. I enjoyed partnering with <a href="../contributors.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Ilona</span></a> on this piece, and am proud of it as my final contribution to the OHBM blog.<br>5</p>
<h4><a href="../contributors.html">EKATERINA DOBRYAKOVA</a></h4>
<p>This year I greatly enjoyed interviewing neuroscientists for the OHBM blog. One of the interviews was with the OHBM 2019 keynote speaker, <a href="ohbm-2019-keynote-interview-tianzi-jiang.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0134fa">Tianzi Jiang</span></a>. The second was for a blog on<a href="using-mri-to-understand-neurological-conditions-multiple-sclerosis.html" target="_blank"> understanding neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis</a>, reaching out to various experts in the multiple sclerosis MRI community for their take on where the field is moving and the value of old and new approaches.</p>

<p>My mission on the OHBM Communications Committee has been to help OHBM extend its communications to Chinese audiences. In my time on this team I I have created a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUwOTAxMjEwMQ==&amp;mid=2247483683&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=547f2dff7cb68dc5fd297465fc5f899d&amp;chksm=f919f0c9ce6e79df3952cb2b190520525d935310e9e062a8381da19a84dff6ade3774b4ebbc1&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=0711xrLCws3mJC4mPMbuBFDK&amp;key=0b0fcc6d62e4018dd7d5f9f9af4e627d07f0535a669f1715f9f82f24abca4dae55ba3cffd552aaec108db861caba4062c1eadaa77321e5e9f76e4fa9298c3919744752185bc81220724e0f16d87d22cb&amp;ascene=0&amp;uin=MTE0MDU5NTkwNA==&amp;devicetype=iMac+MacBookPro11,3+OSX+OSX+10.11.6+build(15G1421)&amp;version=12020510&amp;nettype=WIFI&amp;fontScale=100&amp;pass_ticket=9FvUypuItE5f4fpIvAsTSDJenR0AxgiLXE/kaFhOJdRW1VaryaqDOD9/DG9xhRy+" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0335fd">Wechat Official Account for OHBM</span></a>, on which we translated some popular OHBM blogs and news from OHBM. More importantly, working with the OHBM China Chapter, we have hosted three Annual Chinese Young Scholars events for OHBM (<a href="ohbm-2017-highlights-the-inaugural-chinese-young-scholars-meeting.html" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a href="ohbm-2018-chinese-young-scholars-for-human-brain-mapping.html" target="_blank">2018</a>, <a href="the-3rd-annual-ohbm-chinese-young-scholars-event.html" target="_blank">2019</a>). These events aim to bring together Chinese researchers with diverse backgrounds to discuss and collaborate on cutting edge neuroscience research topics and methods. As my term at the Committee comes to an end, I hope to continue working with the Committee to organize these events and help improve collaborations between the Chinese brain imaging community and OHBM.</p>

<p>This year I had the pleasure and honor of interviewing one of the OHBM 2019 keynote speakers, <a href="ohbm2019-keynotes-armin-raznahan-genes-environment-the-developing-brain-and-everything-in-between.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr Armin Raznahan</span></a>, on his career path and exciting research combining genetics, neuroimaging, and child brain development. My next blog post echoed key themes from the OHBM conference in Rome with that of the first <a href="bringing-great-minds-together-and-signaling-to-ohbm-in-rome-human-brain-mapping-israel-1st-conference.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Israeli Human neuroimaging conference took place in Jerusalem</span></a> focusing on unique neuroimaging acquisition methods, pathologies and child brain development. Last but not least, we are currently working on an exciting blog article exploring the relations between screens exposure and brain development. Can’t wait for the topics we will cover in 2020!</p>
<h4><a href="../contributors.html">CLAUDE JULIEN BAJADA</a></h4>
<p>2019 has been a whirlwind! I spent most of my time writing two “How-to” blogs focused on <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-machine-learning-in-neuroimaging.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">machine learning in neuroimaging</span></a> and, my favorite topic, <a href="ohbm-ondemand-how-to-diffusion-mri.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">diffusion MRI</span></a>. I also interviewed one of the 2018 OHBM keynote speakers; <a href="ohbm2019-keynotes-thomas-yeo.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Thomas Yeo</span></a> where he described his path from electrical engineering to neuroscience. The experience collaborating with colleagues to write the educational blogs has been amazing, and the response from the community heartening. I look forward to more “How-to” in 2020!</p>
