You might even find inspiration on the way to participate in this year’s edition of the competition. To get to know about the Brain-Art SIG mission, I asked the board their personal experiences with Brain art and how this SIG came about. </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Brain-Art SIG vision for OHBM: Interview with the boardRoselyne Chauvin (RC): </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">So what is the view of Brain-Art SIG’s officials on art and science interactions and, personally, what motivated you to join the board of this SIG? </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Alain Dagher, Chair (AD): </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My answer is roughly half-way between “Because Daniel M asked me” and “because art and neuroscience both often seek to explain the human experience.” </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Valentina Borghesani, Secretary (VB): </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I agree with Alain: human beings are way too complex to be tackled only from a scientific perspective, one needs to embrace diverse forms of expression/investigation. Personally, while being totally void of any artistic talent whatsoever, I love being involved in the scientific community and do…the leg work! One day I saw on the brainhack slack workspace that they were looking for volunteers for this to-be-established SIG and… First lesson learned: things do escalate quickly around these folks! </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Aman Badhwar, Chair-Elect (AB): </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As far back as I can remember, I have been fascinated by art, and started painting as a child. In my view, science and art both seek to observe, record and explain the world around us, just using different means. Both have their theoretical frameworks, evolving techniques, and schools of thought. Above all, both scientists and artists need to be creative and insightful in order to make meaningful contributions to their respective fields. In one direction, I use painting as a means of communicating ideas from my scientific work to the public using the more visceral, emotional language of art. In the other direction, when grappling with a thorny scientific problem, the distinct focus required while painting frees my subconscious mind from conceptual boundaries and dogmatic ideas, and allows me to return to my scientific work with fresh eyes. Some people have told me that one cannot be a scientist and an artist at the same time, and that it is necessary to choose. Personally, I find that art synergizes with my academic endeavours, and provides me with a clarity that is sometimes hard to find in the barrage of scientific data.I was first told about Neuro Bureau and its OHBM art competition by Pierre Bellec. It was 2014, and I was having my first solo art exhibit at CRIUGM, University of Montreal. The next thing I know I was having this intense conversation with this “highly energetic, mile a minute person” (well compared to me as I internalize my energy, and Pierre, I would say, is the opposite), who was convinced that I needed to submit my art to the Neuro Bureau art competition. I did not know who Pierre was, had never been to the OHBM, but the art was submitted, and a couple of months later, again a very enthusiastic Pierre informed me that I had won one of the categories. Life has a funny way of working sometimes, because the next year (2015), I found myself being a postdoc at Pierre B’s lab, going to my first OHBM meeting, and being intensely involved in the Neuro Bureau/OHBM art activities.  </span></span><strong><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">RC:</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Your </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3911&amp;activateFull=true"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Brain-Art SIG</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> page states that you aim to:</span></span></strong><ul><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">encourage artistic approaches and perspectives to understand human brain function, </span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">facilitate the development of novel approaches for the visualization of scientific data </span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">provide a model of interaction between disciplines while enhancing the public outreach of OHBM </span></span></li></ul><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Outside of the exhibit and competition, what other tasks would you like to start to reach these goals?

At the prosaic level, better data visualization can improve communication of scientific results, and ease the work of reviewers (making your paper more likely to be published). But just as we need to emphasize the aesthetic side of brain imaging visualization, we also need to incorporate concepts of openness and reproducibility, i.e. make sure the data-to-image generation process is transparent. </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">VB: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Improving our current scientific visualization practices is clearly one of the expected, let’s say, side effects. Graphical abstracts and cross-disciplinary hackathons sound great way to enrich our SIG activities! However, I would like to point out that our concept of Art cannot be resolved in visual arts, as we clearly stress with this year’s award categories. Only embracing the heterogeneity of tools and perspectives the Arts can offer us, we will appreciate the full potential of this dialogue. Neuroscience can definitely exploit this diversity when it comes to outreach, both within (interactive graphical abstracts? performative poster presentations? Why not!) and outside our community (e.g., reach the general public honoring the different ways information can be assimilated and digested). But the benefit of integrating more insights from the Arts will also be seen in how it will unleash scientists’ creativity and divergent thinking. It’s not only about finding new ways of showing our results, but also exploring new point of views. </span></span><strong><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">RC: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">For now, you have a board that is composed of:</span></span></strong></p>
