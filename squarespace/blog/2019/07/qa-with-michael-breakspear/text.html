<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a">After the success of the first Australian chapter meeting and the announcement of the OHBM publishing platform Aperture in 2018, the OHBM communications committee took the opportunity to meet Michael Breakspear in Rome to get to know more about brain mapping developments in Australia as well as the progress of The OHBM Publishing Initiative Committee (TOPIC).</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">Roselyne Chauvin (RC): Hi. Thank you for giving me a bit of time in your busy schedule during OHBM.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>Michael Breakspear (MB): </strong>Pleasure!</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: So it's the 25th anniversary of OHBM, what has been your experience with the meeting?</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>MB: Well, I first went to OHBM in 2001 when it was in New York. So actually, I don't go back 25 years, I go back 18 years. And I think I've been to nearly all of them, except maybe the one in Florence. Because my twins were born that day. So I couldn't come to Italy.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: It was a good excuse at that time and we are back in Italy.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>MB: Yeah. So it's a wonderful meeting. I mean, it's an opportunity to present your work, to hear cutting edge work from others. I think one of the advantages of OHBM is that people are prepared to present work that's ongoing, rather than work that's finished. And they'll be brave enough to present work that they haven't submitted yet. So you have that feel of work in progress, as well as work that's been completed. Obviously, it's also an opportunity to meet colleagues and network, and see people that you might not see for the rest of the year.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: ...and I also know that it was the first Australian chapter meeting this year.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Yes, we had the Australian chapter. We formed that last year. I guess it all started at OHBM, we see each other and obviously, we're meeting with our international colleagues. We decided that we would be meeting as a community in Australia once a year, and building strength in numbers in Australia, and collaborating more. So we had a meeting in Melbourne. I think that was last year, 2018. And we're meeting in October this year in Newcastle. There were over 120 people at the last meeting, and many of the initiatives that you see at OHBM, diversity initiatives, open science initiatives, were really at the forefront of the meeting that Dan Lubman and Alex Fornito organized in Melbourne, too. That was very exciting, with lots of presentations from mid-career researchers.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: There is a push to collaborate more between centers, I heard that there are new initiatives along these lines in Australia with more investment in equipment.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Yeah, I think in the last five years, we've had a lot of investment in equipment. So we have two 7T, we have lots of 3T Prisma, we have PET-MR, we have all the vendors represented there. We have MEG with a new MEG center down in Melbourne [see details below]. What we need now is more investment in personnel, human resources, postdoc’s career development, people working across centers with the skills that allow state-of-the-art imaging analysis. And that's what OHBM in Australia is trying to achieve. So that if we have implemented a human connectome protocol in Brisbane, then we can roll it out in Melbourne and Sydney. And of course, it comes with particular pipelines that we put on GitHub, and then we can share those as well. And I think that's the two main things in Australia at the moment, working collaboratively around acquisition and analysis. And also well, in Australia, we fortunately have a fantastic health system. So we're looking at large longitudinal studies, particularly in dementia.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: And so there’s a push for collaboration and investment in people; should people at OHBM look toward Australia to find jobs?</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Yeah, we have lots of positions being advertised at the moment. But we’re also lobbying state and federal government to make sure that any capital investment is matched with investment in salary and personnel. We’re creating data hubs and imaging analysis hubs that can straddle between different institutes, and working with clinicians so that clinical studies are using state-of-the-art imaging. Because there's historically been a gap between what the brain mapping community is doing and what the clinical community is using on the scanner to do their studies. So we're trying to close that gap.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: I wanted to also talk about your editorial activity. I know that you are part of the TOPIC initiative in OHBM. Can you tell us more about that? And so what is your vision about the future of the publishing system?</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Well, I'm working with the TOPIC collective, we might say it's a fairly loosely knit group of people, to try and create, with new technology, the ability to curate, review, and publish in an open way, a diverse variety of content.  In addition to traditional papers and review papers, we are looking into publishing code, data, tutorials, and Nikola Stikov has been working on transparency in publishing, so you can look at the source code, interact and experiment with the figures, and to allow traditional review, if authors and reviewers would like that, but also to encourage different forms of open and post-publication peer review. You see this already in a journal like eLife. I've been fortunate to be an editor in eLife and, of course, I'm editor-in-chief of Neuroimage. So we're seeing different models. Now we're working together to help the open science community at OHBM to make these ideas a practical reality.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: Do you think OHBM can help in promoting those new systems and maybe experiment with it?</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>It's absolutely crucial that the OHBM community come on board. First of all, just to step back a little bit, I was treasurer on Council. And with all the other council members, we, in communication with the membership, decided to move OHBM towards a society, and then add on a new scene of communications, the communications committee, add on a lot of other activities around OHBM, in addition to the annual meeting. And so the publication platform is part of that. So first of all, there is an investment in starting up the platform. We want the OHBM members to be submitting content, to be reviewing. And we're looking at merit based systems for enthusiastic reviewers to move into editorial roles. And also move to an open source platform. We don't see it as a competition with the big journals, we see it as an alternative. But it needs to be a viable alternative where people are putting their best work and are confident that it's also contributing to their career progression.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: We are still at the stage of the exploration and experimenting around those different alternative.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Yes, definitely. So this is making it a reality.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: Yeah, exactly. It's impressive, your activity between your research and editorial activities. How do you split your time?</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Well, my passion is always for doing research, doing experiments, I get a lot of pleasure out of mentoring my early and mid-career researchers and several of them are now faculty and that's one of the best things that can happen to somebody to see their postdocs become independent. But you know, I've always been passionate to stay involved in curation of the data.  I came into the field as a computational neuroscientist so I do a lot of programming, and occasionally even doing a bit of actual maths. I think if I got to the point where I wasn't doing that anymore, I'd be very frustrated as a researcher.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: You would lose track of what's going on in the field.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Yeah, in terms of the editorial work and the other work,the good thing is that you're working with colleagues and at OHBM, we're friends, we go out to dinner, and we have lots of discussions. There's a sense of community there with people at the same career stage as I'm not a mid career researcher anymore. You're not doing it as a solo activity. It's a collaboration with people outside of science. For example, publishing in a traditional journal is a collaboration with commercial publishers and people who have been trained in law, ethics, dealing with dilemmas around co-authorship, plagiarism, etc, etc. But my passion always will remain in doing the basic computational and data analysis.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><span style="font-weight:700">RC: It matters a lot to be able to get the balance. It was a pleasure to talk to you and to find out more about activities in Australia. Thank you very much for your time.</span></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span><strong>MB: </strong>Okay. Cheers. Thank you.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><em><span><span style="font-weight:700">For more information:</span></span></em><br><span>In Australia there is a National Imaging Facility through which our imaging infrastructure is funded (https://anif.org.au/). On that website is an extensive list of all the current imaging facilities in Australia.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>Australian imaging is around a fantastic new investment in infrastructure, including new equipment and upgrades to old equipment, across the entire country.
