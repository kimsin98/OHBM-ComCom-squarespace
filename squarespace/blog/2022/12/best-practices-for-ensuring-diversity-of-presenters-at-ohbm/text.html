<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">What does “diversity of presenters” mean?</span></span><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Diversity is achieved by including people from a range of different backgrounds. In considering diversity of speakers at the OHBM Annual Meeting, we encourage organizers to consider the categories included in our code of conduct, namely: diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Note that this list is not exhaustive, and that the geographic diversity dimension can include both the current country of residency (where individuals live and work today) as well as a person’s past experiences (where they completed training and their work history). For example, it would make sense that the geographic location where a person has studied or worked for a long period (e.g., several decades) may in some cases be considered to a greater extent than the country where the individual has citizenship by birth. One way to clarify this information is to collect information about the amount of time a potential presenter has stayed or is staying at a given location, or whether the individual is an immigrant. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">How can we achieve a balance of speakers? </span></span><br><em><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Concrete suggestions to Symposium/Educational Course organizers </span></span></em><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When brainstorming which speakers to invite, one suggestion to increase diversity is to look for speakers beyond one's first-order personal professional network. Increasing the pool of proposed speakers beyond one's usual network will first and foremost increase the quality and breadth of ideas related to the symposium or educational course. Diversity in speakers will add new perspectives, methodologies, and research questions, and it will inevitably result in </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">more innovative</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> scientific content. Finding speakers outside one’s network can be accomplished by contacting affinity groups (see<strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCaCkVdhpeFKkPqYxK_9IGAj63PhRlo1iVb-kAkruEM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">our list of affinity groups</a></strong>) that are organized around specific identities to seek eligible individuals with the relevant expertise on a given topic. This will entail including speakers from underrepresented backgrounds and geographical locations as well as considering gender, ethnicity, and career levels when choosing co-presenters. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another way to identify potential speakers is through the examination of panels and shorter talks from recent events organized by early career researchers (e.g., </span><a href="https://ossig.netlify.app/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Open Science</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and </span><a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Brainhack</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> events). Sometimes these types of smaller events bring in speakers who are less “well known” but still provide excellent scientific contributions. Drawing from these types of events can help increase the diversity of speakers by including those from earlier career stages. In addition, instead of defaulting to asking a well known principal investigator to present, consider asking postdocs and other senior scientists working in that same group to participate in your symposium/educational course proposal. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Program Committee could consider limiting submissions from speakers who have had the opportunity to present at the conference recently (e.g., within the last 1–2 years).

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In summary, we propose several ways to increase diversity in speakers at the annual OHBM meeting with the goal of improving scientific contributions and broadening our brain mapping horizons. We strongly believe that each and every one of us can drive this change during our proposal submissions, and at a larger scale, by suggesting concrete actions to the OHBM leadership.</span></p>
