<p>Latin America (LATAM) is a region formed by countries and territories united by romance languages and a similarly complicated history of colonization by Spain, Portugal and France. LATAM spans from Mexico in North America to Central and South America, as well as countries in the Caribbean like Cuba. Most countries in LATAM are considered as developing: their academic and research funding is usually lower than developed countries, and 3 Tesla MRI scanners are usually found in hospitals and shared by researchers and clinicians, a situation that is always challenging. Some countries even have only a single 3T MRI scanner. That said, there have been great efforts by neuroimaging groups in the last 20 years to develop research and education. Researchers in LATAM who studied neuroimaging in the US, Canada or Europe, came back and have been training new students and developing their own research, usually building MRI labs from scratch. Now, there is a new generation of LATAM trained researchers pushing the field forward. Here, we consider how researchers from these countries have grown and developed neuroimaging research in the region.</p>
<p>LATAM has always been a melting pot for ethnicities and cultures, and it is now an important region for scientific endeavour due to its unique demographic, linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity. This means that not only large-scale neuroimaging projects are in the works, but also unique studies and study samples, from domains such as psychology, anthropology, the arts and health. Notably, LATAM researchers are known for excellent international collaborations. With this in mind, I would like to provide an overview of some of the neuroimaging projects and researchers in LATAM by country, with the hope of future scientific collaboration between these and other countries. This is not a comprehensive list, and this work was possible thanks to those researchers who responded to my emails and <a href="https://twitter.com/egarzav/status/1436329114496126980"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Twitter announcement</span></a>.</p>

<p>Because every population is specific, it was important to create a Mexican database, as Mexico has a unique genetic and cultural mixture of at least 3 roots: Pre-columbian indigenous, Spanish and African. We plan to explore brain structure and function of identical and fraternal twins, to study heritability and ambientality of several of their properties. We will also explore diverse relationships between structure and function, and physical and mental health in the Mexican population”.</p>

To this end, we use diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and other forms of quantitative imaging. Our work has shown associations between brain connectivity and cognitive performance in patients with epilepsy. Since some questions cannot be answered through the study of clinical populations, we also use animal models to follow and understand the process of epileptogenesis. Because dMRI is a rapidly-evolving field, and as this method holds promise as a powerful tool to infer information regarding tissue microstructure, I’m also interested in testing and validating the true extent of such promise.  </p>
<p>Through studies in rodents, our lab has shown that certain methods such as multi-tensor approaches and constrained spherical deconvolution can indeed correctly identify and individually assess intact and damaged axonal populations even when they intermingle within a single image voxel, while providing raw and processed dMRI and histology for the community to further validate other methods that may be developed in the near future”.</p>

Among the research topics that are conducted, we can find the microstructure characterization of brain white matter tissue from diffusion-weighted MR data. </p>
<p>In particular, our group focuses on the estimation of axon bundle descriptors at the mesoscale (e.g. the “MRDS” method), as well as on the computation of microstructural indexes of axonal density and axonal orientation dispersion (as for instance the “ED^3” method). By globally integrating the local descriptors of brain tissue, one can generate information about brain connectivity on the scale of millimeters (this process is known as "brain tractography"). In this field, our group has been working on the development of methods to robustly estimate the cortico-cortical neural connections (e.g. the “Flocking Tractography” method) and also in the characterization of the topological features of the brain connectomes (graphs built based on neurological global connectivity). The majority of the research methods are developed with the objective to be applied in clinical settings, that is to say, the methods should work on scenarios with realistic levels of machine noise and with a small as possible number of MR acquisitions or images.”</p>

Then, we established a collaboration with the Uruguayan center that owned the only 3T scanner in the country, and built an fMRI set up and we are now running the first fMRI projects of our country.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to investigate the decision-making and neural substrates associated with mental health disorders, such as depression and social anxiety. In the last few years, we have specially focused on the neural mechanisms underlying social difficulties in these populations. This is relevant as depression and social anxiety have a profound impact on social functioning. In the last few years, the need for studying social interactions across mental disorders using experimental tasks that actively recreate interactions and immerse the participant in a social context has been emphasized. In our group, we use multiplayer tasks from behavioural economics, as well as tasks designed in our group, to recreate social scenarios that allow studying brain activation during active social exchanges. One of our current projects examines the neural basis of social comparison processes in depression and social anxiety.”</p>
