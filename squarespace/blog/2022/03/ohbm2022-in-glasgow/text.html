<p>This year, OHBM’s annual meeting will be held in Glasgow, in Bonnie Scotland! This 28th annual meeting, from the 19th to 23rd of June, features a packed scientific programme where you’ll discover the latest in neuroimaging developments from around the world. At the same time, there’ll be a whole host of events to facilitate networking, to show you the delights of the Scottish Lowlands, and to quench that thirst for physical conferences that many of us have developed over the past years*.</p>
<p>The conference is geared for researchers at all career stages. The core of the meeting remains the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4109"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">keynote speakers</span></a> and symposia. This year you can hear from our Talairach awardee, <a href="https://surgery.utoronto.ca/faculty-focus-andres-lozano" target="_blank">Prof Andres Lozano</a>, about his truly phenomenal work combining imaging with deep brain stimulation. Find out about the brain basis of social decision making from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Social-Affective-NeuroPharmacology-Lab-Yina-Ma" target="_blank">Dr Yina Ma</a>, machine learning models and pattern recognition in neuroimaging from <a href="https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/person/104603/2813" target="_blank">Prof Janaina Mourao-Miranda</a>, and about how oscillatory brain activity enables cognition from <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/jensen-ole.aspx" target="_blank">Prof Ole Jensen</a>, amongst others. Take part in Sunday’s <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4055"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">educational events</span></a>, where you can learn from world-leading experts about quantitative MRI, neuroanatomy, physiologic fMRI, time varying functional connectivity, or develop a core understanding in <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4055"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">a number of fields</span></a>. </p>
<p>Join in with the open science activities. The annual <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM hackathon</span></a> takes place in Glasgow from the 16th to 18th June. The open science room, now a central feature of the annual meeting, has activities planned throughout - symposia, table topics (with group discussions and Q&amp;As) and emergent sessions. Find out how researchers from developing countries have tackled open science practices and what they’ve learned, debunk myths about open code and learn about various career paths in academia and industry after the PhD. Dive into the many activities covering the sea of open science - how can you miss out on that? </p>
<p>Once you’re saturated with ideas for new experiments from the talks and posters, amble out to find that whilst Glasgow may not be as well known as Edinburgh, it offers a less crowded, more authentic Scottish experience (perhaps with your new collaborators from the poster hall):<br>​</p>

<p style="text-align: right; display: block">If you want to <a href="https://businessevents.visitscotland.com/why-scotland/extend-your-trip/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">travel further afield</span></a>, Scotland has an international reputation for the beauty of its scenery - <a href="https://www.roughguides.com/gallery/the-most-beautiful-places-in-scotland-as-voted-by-you/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">it’s lochs, castles, and cities (like Edinburgh and Stirling), that are steeped</span></a> in ancient history. Loch Lomond, flanked by golf courses, is only an hour away by road or train and so is easily seen on a day trip. If you have more time, why not travel to the picturesque Highlands and Islands for mountain sports, freshly caught seafood in picturesque harbour towns, or whisky fresh from the distillery. </p>
<p>So to those who want to really savour the many experiences that in-person international meetings bring, we look forward to seeing you in Scotland to say cheers or Slàinte Mhath ("Slanj-a-va": good health).</p>
<p>*And for those who are unable or would prefer not to travel, there’s a whole range of activities on offer at the virtual OHBM 2022 meeting - with more info to come on that soon!</p>
<p>**Scotch whisky is always spelt without the e. As someone once said: “...there’s no such thing as a bad whisky, but those with an e are suspect”. </p>
<p>Also, note that Glasgow rhymes with ‘go’, or to be fully local, is pronounced Glesga.</p>
