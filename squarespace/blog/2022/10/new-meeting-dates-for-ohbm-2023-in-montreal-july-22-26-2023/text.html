<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">On October 14, the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">announced</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> that the next Annual Meeting will be held in Montreal on July 22–26, 2023—a one-month change from its previously planned June schedule.</span></span><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Despite the shift in the dates of the Annual Meeting itself, other logistics remain largely unchanged: the conference will be held in the Montréal Palais de Congrès, and content submissions will still be open from October 15 until the December 20 deadline (which is rigidly enforced so that members can enjoy the late December holiday season without the added stress of conference submissions).</span></span></p>
<p><font color="#2a2a2a">With such a dramatic change to the upcoming calendar, it’s critical for the human brain mapping community to know what to expect for OHBM 2023 so that they can plan for the new schedule. To that end, we communicated with <a target="_blank" href="https://gmpartners.org/alexander-shun/">Alex Shun</a> (Communications Manager at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3332">OHBM Executive Office</a>), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/michele-veldsman">Michele Veldsman</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3910">OHBM Council Secretary</a>), and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/about-us/research-staff/michel-thiebaut-de-schotten-phd/">Michel Thiebaut de Schotten</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3910">OHBM Council Chair</a>) to discuss the reasons for the change, the decision-making process, and the issues and opportunities that arise from this date shift.</font><br>​<br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight:700">Why have the dates of OHBM 2023 in Montreal changed, and why was the decision made at this point?</span></span><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight:700">Michel Thiebaut de Schotten (MTdS)</span>: The <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Canada.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Canadian Grand Prix</span></a> is typically held in June in Montreal, but until very recently we didn’t know dates—it’s usually earlier in the month.

The Executive Office was in close contact with our local vendors as we awaited the Grand Prix schedule to be publicized and worked to create a solution when we learned of the overlap. Accommodation prices, flights, social venue costs, and the overall ease of getting around the city would have hugely impacted our community and we wanted to ensure our attendees have a positive experience in Montreal.</span></p>

Trish then immediately called the venue to find out available dates. Since the Annual Meeting requires five consecutive days, July 22–26 was the only window open to us. (And, in fact, we’re fortunate that there was any time available this summer.) The three of us made the proposal to shift the Annual Meeting to the new July dates, and we contacted Council to approve the proposal, which took about one day of email exchanges. </span></span></p>
