<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="4" color="#000"><span style="font-weight:700">The problem</span></font><br><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">One of the great things about science is that it brings people together from around the world. These international connections allow people to share information and perspectives, driving knowledge forward. They also give us opportunities to meet new, interesting people and in doing so perhaps understand the world a little better. Unfortunately though, the possibility for people to come together physically from long distances also has some downsides for this planet that we all share.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">As we know, Earth is facing a climate crisis. Human-induced changes in the climate are already showing their effect and are only set </span><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"><span style="font-weight:400">to get worse</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> in the coming years. One driver of this crisis has been greenhouse gas pollution from air transport, </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ESSOAR.10507359.1"><span style="font-weight:400">representing around 4%</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> of total such emissions. Even though a relatively small part of this total, we all contribute to it when we fly to connect with other scientists.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">The role of scientific conferences</span></font><br><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">The majority of these science-related aviation emissions </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2019.04.109"><span style="font-weight:400">come from people attending scientific conferences</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, and travel to conferences is estimated to account for 91–96% of total emissions [1]. To put it in a real-life context, one person travelling from North America to Asia will produce around three tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) greenhouse gas emissions, which is the same amount as someone in a low-income country will generate in a decade. </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all conference locations contribute equally to the emissions. Looking at </span><a href="https://ohbm-environment.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEA-SIG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s modelling of previous OHBM conferences (Figure 1), we can see that travel to Hawaii in 2015 was the most polluting in terms of total CO2e emissions. Singapore in 2018 produced less CO2e overall, but tops the list in terms of emissions per person, at over five tonnes. </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, hosting the conference in Rome produced the least amount of CO2e per person (but note, still over three tonnes each). These figures illustrate how the CO2e outcomes for conferences are primarily based on where most OHBM members are located as this determines how far the majority of attendees must travel and by what means. This means that location of future meetings is important for minimising our carbon footprint. </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as meeting in person in locations that minimise the need for long-haul flights, there are lots of complementary approaches to consider. Post-Covid, we will see a transformation of traditional conference models, in which everybody comes together to meet in one place (Figure 2). As a community, we need to consider other models where that would not be a necessity. These include </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">hybrid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (online and in-person options), and in-person approaches such as a </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">‘hub’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model, in which there are multiple meeting locations, and attendees can travel to their nearest. We could also save carbon by meeting in person on a </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">biennial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> basis (every other year), alternating with meeting online in between.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these options are already available, and the adoption of online and hybrid in particular has been accelerated over the past years because of the pandemic. In SEA-SIG’s analyses of the carbon footprint of such alternative approaches, we identified the CO2e emissions produced and saved for OHBM meetings when different models are adopted (Figure 3). These figures assume that virtual conference elements </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40290-022-00421-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">produce around 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the CO2e emissions as in-person ones [1].</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OHBM has already embraced a </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">hybrid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model for Glasgow 2022. If 33% of those who would otherwise fly super-long-haul (&gt;8000km) choose to attend from home, this will save an estimated third of emissions compared to the Rome conference. This </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">hybrid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model not only saves emissions but can also open up access to people who could not previously attend the conference due to financial, political, or personal reasons. However, for </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">hybrid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OHBM meetings to be a success, it will be important for all attendees - including those coming to Glasgow - to fully engage with the online aspects being held on 7-8th June. This will be an opportunity for OHBM colleagues to get together and support our poster presenters wherever they are around the world.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, another option is to have regional </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">hubs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a conference which would replace a single central location. Combined with hybrid access, this model could save an estimated 80% of greenhouse gas pollution from air travel. The pros and cons of distributed models like this will be a major topic of discussion within the scientific community in the coming years. SEA-SIG’s forthcoming publication will discuss these options and suggest a vision for how we can connect more sustainably in the coming years.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">It’s not just conferences</span></font><br><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although conference travel accounts for the majority of science-related aviation pollution, other aspects of academia also require people to travel long distances. Giving talks at different universities is an expected part of the job, as are attending panels at grant agencies and scientific committees. Notably though, this is chiefly concentrated around a minority of senior researchers, and fortunately the trend is changing. More senior scientists are recognising the disproportionate role they play in carbon emission and are pledging to </span><a href="http://www.russpoldrack.org/2019/06/why-i-will-be-flying-less.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fly less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://noflyclimatesci.org/biographies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://flightlessprofessors.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for career-related events. This change is benefiting less senior scientists as well through easy access to talks and events held online, which enables them to share their work and make connections without the need of travelling. At the same time, grant agencies and scientific societies are following suit and are moving meetings and discussion online.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="4" color="#000"><span style="font-weight:700">We need to get there somehow</span></font><br><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">Of course, meeting with our friends and colleagues in person will remain necessary (and desirable). On some occasions, we can choose to make the journey in a more sustainable manner, in particular by swapping the plane for the train, when possible. </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">For many journeys, this choice doesn’t add much time to the trip when travelling to airports and the time spent queuing when one gets there is taken into account. For example, someone going from Paris to Glasgow for OHBM2022 will spend around 6h15m travelling by plane, compared to around 7h30m by train. The same person going to Berlin for a meeting would spend 6h50m travelling by plane and around 8h30m by train. By taking the train to Glasgow and Berlin instead, one would save 200 and 210 kg of CO2e, respectively (calculated using the </span><a href="http://ecopassenger.hafas.de/bin/query.exe/en?L=vs_uic&amp;"><span style="font-weight:400">EcoPassenger tool</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">). </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">Taking the train is a great option for scientists in Asia too, with high-speed rail networks available in many countries that often host large conferences, such as Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. To put it in perspective, travelling from Beijing to Shanghai will take about seven hours by plane but only 5h30m by train, saving 360 kg of CO2e. </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">One more benefit of travelling by train is that a group or friends or colleagues can travel together, having fun along the way and saving the hassle of airport queues. For OHBM2022 in Glasgow, if you’re getting there by train then you can find fellow attendees who are also going by train with the twitter hashtag #trainparty.</span></font></p>
