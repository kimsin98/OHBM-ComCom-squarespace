<p class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><em>On behalf of the OHBM Diversity &amp; Inclusivity Committee</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222">The last two years have brought new challenges for the members of our global OHBM community. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated existing inequities in having access to healthcare, including vaccines. During this time, we have also witnessed persistent racial and/or ethnocultural discrimination, which continues to affect members of our Society around the globe. Finally, while our recent </span><a href="results-from-the-survey-on-inclusivity-at-ohbm-summary-and-future-directions.html"><span style="color: #0b5394">survey</span></a><span style="color: #222"> indicated that many of our members have reported positive changes that support Diversity and Inclusivity at OHBM in the past two years, there is still a major lack of geographical representation within our Council and at our annual meeting.  We, </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3313"><span style="color: #15c">the OHBM Diversity &amp; Inclusivity Committee</span></a><span style="color: #222">, will continue to shine a light on these issues by discussing existing barriers and proposing solutions at the OHBM meeting Diversity Symposium and Roundtable events. We also continue to engage the “scientists of the future” around the world in our 2nd annual multilingual Kids Live Review (virtual) events.</span></p>
<p><span class="sqsrte-large"><span style="font-weight: 700">The 4th annual DIC Symposium: The Asian perspective</span></span><br>This year we will host a panel discussion from the Asian perspective on the effects of social, cultural, and language barriers on inclusivity at OHBM. We are thrilled that Bharat Biswal (country of origin: India), Kangjoo Lee (country of origin: South Korea), Natasha Rajah (country of origin: Sri Lanka), Hiromasa Takemura (country of origin: Japan), and Chao-Gan Yan (country of origin: China) will be joining us for this first-time-ever event <span style="font-weight: 700">(Fig.1).</span><span style="color: #f00"> </span>The in-person panel will take place as an afternoon symposium on Monday June 20th (14.15 - 15.30 GMT+1, Lomond Auditorium), but don’t worry if you can’t make it! We’ll also have a pre-recorded version available online. </p>
<p><span class="sqsrte-large"><span style="font-weight: 700">The 3rd edition of the Kids Live Review: Even more multilingual</span></span><br>We are excited to continue our multilingual Kids Live Review events this year, boosted by the heightened interest within the OHBM community and beyond! Did you miss last year’s reviews? No worries, you can still enjoy the pre-recorded videos in <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLocwiMktiT-6qUcqfP1qronR16EHLW3NM"><span style="color: #15c">this playlist</span></a>. This year we are featuring eight languages: children speaking English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish will be able to act as reviewers for the latest journal publications presented by multilingual OHBM-member volunteers <span style="font-weight: 700">(Fig.2)</span>.</p>
<p>Whether in school with their teachers or at home with their parents, kids will be able to watch the prerecorded talk in their native language with subtitles. Next, during our annual meeting, they will attend the virtual live Q&amp;A session and directly ask questions to the presenters, learning where we are at the forefront of human brain mapping.<span style="color: #222"> Interested?

Across multiple special interest groups within the society, several exciting initiatives have emerged over the past years as we’ve worked to express the values of diversity and inclusivity in all of our activities.
