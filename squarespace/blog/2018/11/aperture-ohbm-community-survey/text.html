<p>OHBM plans to create a new publishing platform, <a href="announcing-aperture-the-ohbm-publishing-platform.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Aperture</span></a>, to host high-quality research objects while promoting reproducible and open science. With Aperture, OHBM plans to open up to a more diverse approach in communicating academic research, bringing transparency and interactivity to the publishing process. We want to hear from you, the OHBM community, about what you would like to see in such a publishing platform.</p>
