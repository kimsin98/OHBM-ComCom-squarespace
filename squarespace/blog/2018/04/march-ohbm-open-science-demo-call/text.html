<p>This month we continued our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Open Science Demo Call</span></a> series by speaking to <a href="https://github.com/TimVanMourik"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Tim van Mourik</span></a> <a href="https://grg.sice.indiana.edu"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Eleftherios Garyfallidis</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/msandstr"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Malin Sandström</span></a> about the communities they’re building and supporting to make everyone’s lives easier through better open source software tools.</p>
<p style="display: block">After a few technical difficulties (Kirstie’s laptop inexplicably deleted the “broadcast” button so we were all chatting to each other without being able to include our viewers in the conversation!) Tim introduced <a href="https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Porcupine</span></a>. Porcupine is a tool to visually program your analysis. By dragging and dropping modules that represent functions in your analysis, you can quickly build an insightful analysis and then Porcupine will provide the code that you or others need to run on your own data. All code and documentation is openly available at the project’s <a href="https://github.com/TimVanMourik"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">GitHub repository</span></a>, and this is where you can also give any feedback or suggestions. Alternatively you can find Tim in the <a href="https://brainhack.slack.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">BrainHack Slack team</span></a> (click <a href="https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a> if you need an invitation to join) or via email at t.vanmourik@donders.ru.nl.</p>
<p style="display: block">Eleftherios told us about <a href="http://dipy.org"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">DIPY</span></a>, a global, community-supported, software project for computational neuroanatomy, focusing mainly on structural and diffusion MRI. DIPY implements a broad range of algorithms for denoising, registration, reconstruction, microstructure, tracking, clustering, visualization, and statistical analysis of MRI data. You can get involved and help the DIPY team in many different ways, but Eleftherios particularly encouraged OHBM members to test their data with the DIPY algorithms and provide feedback on any challenges they have running the code. You can ask questions in the team’s <a href="https://gitter.im/nipy/dipy"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">live chatroom</span></a> or send an e-mail to neuroimaging@python.org.</p>
<p style="display: block">Linking very nicely to Eleftherios’ call for student applicants to work on the DIPY team’s <a href="https://github.com/nipy/dipy/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">suggested projects</span></a> was Malin Sandström, <a href="https://www.incf.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">INCF</span></a>’s community manager who manages the organization’s <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Google Summer of Code</span></a> (GSoC) program. GSoC allows students to be financed with stipends for their work on open source software over the summer. Open source organizations in the project contribute project ideas and mentors. INCF is participating as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6190297818595328/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">GSoC mentoring organization</span></a> for the 8th year in a row, with mentors from the worldwide INCF community and a wide range of neuro-tool projects.</p>
<p style="display: block">You can browse the <a href="https://www.incf.org/activities/training/gsoc-2018-project-ideas"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">INCF project list</span></a> to learn more about the summer plans. If you were too late to take part this year, we encourage you to keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.incf.org/activities/training/google-summer-of-code"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">INCF GSoC projects page</span></a> for updates on future rounds. If you have a project idea you would like to mentor with INCF for next year, get in touch at gsoc@incf.org by 1st December 2018. </p>
<p style="display: block">Our next call will be on Thursday April 26th at 7pm BST (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180426T180000&amp;p1=136"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">check your local time zone</span></a>).
