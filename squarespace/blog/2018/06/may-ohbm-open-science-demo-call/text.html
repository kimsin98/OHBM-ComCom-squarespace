<p><span class="sqsrte-large">By <a href="http://emdupre.me/"><span style="color: #15c">Elizabeth DuPre</span></a> and <a href="https://whitakerlab.github.io/about/"><span style="color: #15c">Kirstie Whitaker</span></a></span></p>
<p>This month we continued our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls"><span style="color: #15c">Open Science Demo Call</span></a> series with a focus on this year’s OHBM annual meeting in Singapore, and the many ways that OHBM members promote open science at the meeting. We heard from <a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/michele-veldsman"><span style="color: #15c">Michele Veldsman</span></a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayaka_Ando"><span style="color: #15c">Ayaka Ando</span></a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/akinikolaidis"><span style="color: #15c">Aki Nikolaidis </span></a>from the student and postdoc special interest group; <a href="http://gkiar.me/"><span style="color: #15c">Greg Kiar</span></a> and <a href="http://ilabs.washington.edu/postdoctoral-fellows/bio/i-labs-anisha-keshavan"><span style="color: #15c">Anisha Keshevan</span></a> from the open science special interest group; and <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/site/nilsmuhlert/"><span style="color: #15c">Nils Muhlert</span></a> from the communications committee.</p>
<p style="display: block">We first heard from Aki about the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/monday-night-social/"><span style="color: #15c">Monday Night Social</span></a>, featuring beautiful views of the Singapore skyline and an announcement of the winners of this year’s <a href="http://www.neurobureau.org/brainart/"><span style="color: #15c">Brain Art competition</span></a>. All OHBM members are encouraged to attend! Ayaka gave us a sneak peak into this year’s career development symposium, <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/annual-symposium/"><span style="color: #15c">'The Secrets Behind Success'</span></a> with presentations from Tom Nichols and Lucina Uddin. Michelle told us about the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/mentoring-programme/"><span style="color: #15c">mentorship program</span></a>, which seeks to support professional growth at all career levels, from masters students to principal investigators. Although mentors and mentees meet at the OHBM annual meeting, you don’t have to be attending to get involved! Aki, Ayaka, and Michelle encourage everyone interested in any of these initiatives to stop by one of their events or <a href="https://twitter.com/OHBM_Trainees"><span style="color: #15c">reach out on twitter</span></a>!</p>
<p style="display: block">Greg and Anisha then told us about this year’s <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2018/"><span style="color: #15c">OHBM BrainHack and TrainTrack</span></a>. Formerly known as the OHBM hackathon, this is a collaborative event which brings together researchers and scientists from across the neuroimaging community to work together on projects, learn new skills, and engage with the community. While registration for the BrainHack and TrainTrack is sold out, the <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceRoom2018"><span style="color: #15c">Open Science Room </span></a>at OHBM will be hosting demos, workshops, and an open working space throughout the annual meeting. Greg and Anisha encourage everybody to come and find out about the great initiatives and individuals in our open science community!</p>
<p style="display: block">Nils introduced us to the amazing work the communications committee is doing to spotlight open science at the meeting and throughout the year. They were involved in revamping the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267"><span style="color: #15c">OHBM website </span></a>and <a href="http://ohbmbrainmappingblog.com"><span style="color: #15c">maintain a blog</span></a> highlighting initiatives within the OHBM community (including these demo calls!), as well as educational materials such as the <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm"><span style="color: #15c">OnDemand courses</span></a>. Nils pointed out that this provides a great way to stay involved year-round (e.g. <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/5158/sections/7777"><span style="color: #15c">workshops on analysing diffusion MRI</span></a>), even for those who cannot attend the annual meeting. The communications committee also helps promote the excellent brain mapping work carried out <a href="human-brain-mapping-in-iran-talking-to-the-scientists.html"><span style="color: #15c">around the world</span></a>, and provides a unique window into the stories of many successful neuroscientists through their <a href="https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/apps/search?q=Keynote+series"><span style="color: #15c">keynote interview series</span></a>. Nils encourages anyone interested in contributing to the blog to <a href="https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/contributor-interest.html"><span style="color: #15c">sign up</span></a>!</p>
<p>We’ll be taking a break next month for the annual meeting, but look forward to starting back up at the end of the summer!
