<p>As we’re swiftly approaching June, we thought we would follow-up our<a href="ohbm-2018-in-singapore.html"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">previous blogpost</span></a> with 10 practical tips to help you make the most of OHBM 2018 in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>1. CLIMATE: </strong>Singapore has a hot and humid tropical climate. The air temperature remains in the mid-twenties (~75°F) even at night, so don’t be surprised if you break a sweat after only a 10 minute walk. For daytime walks, sunscreen is recommended as the UV index can reach extreme levels. Buildings tend to be heavily air-conditioned, so you may also want to pack a sweater for the conference. Also note that the weather is unpredictable, and heavy thunderstorms can develop in just a few minutes, so your weather app is unlikely to be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>2. FOOD:</strong> If you want to grab a quick bite during the conference, there are many cafes and restaurants in the same building (listed<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurants-g2146397-Suntec_Singapore.html"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a>). There are also plenty of dining options at walking distance from the conference centre such as Gluttons Bay, Chijmes and Bussorah street. Shoppers will be glad to know that most stores in the city are open until 10pm, including on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>3. TRANSPORTATION: </strong>The best way to take advantage of Singapore’s public transportation system is by purchasing an ez-link card (same concept as Oyster card in London). Ez-link cards are sold at the airport and at most MRT (subway) stations for a $5 (3.75 USD) deposit. Ez-link works on all buses, MRT lines, and can also be used to pay in some stores, e.g. 7-11s, and some taxis. Pro tip: Remember to tap out with your card when alighting buses to avoid getting charged the maximum fare.</p>
<p><strong>4. MAPS:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Google Maps</span></a> or<a href="https://citymapper.com/singapore?set_region=sg-singapore"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Citymapper</span></a> are great for figuring out the best combination of MRT/bus/walking to get anywhere on the island, including expected travel times, when to alight buses (stops are not announced), and the fastest way to exit MRT stations. Follow this<a href="https://www.suntecsingapore.com/getting-here/"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">link</span></a> for directions to the conference centre.</p>
<p><strong>5. TAXI/RIDESHARE:</strong> All Singapore taxis operate based on metered fare. There is no Uber, but Grab provides a similar service. There are separate pick-up points for metered and Grab taxis at Changi Airport. Pro tip: If you want to keep costs low avoid the Chrysler Cab (black taxis) in the airport taxi queue.</p>
<p><strong>6. GRATUITY: </strong>Tipping is generally not expected in Singapore. Most restaurants automatically add a 10% service charge and a 7% Goods and Services Tax on the bill.</p>
<p><strong>7. PAYMENT METHODS:</strong> Most places in Singapore will accept credit card payment (VISA/Mastercard, though usually not AmEx). However, do keep some cash for dining in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">hawker centres</span></a>. ATMs are widely available in the city and airport.</p>
<p><strong>8. LIQUOR TAX: </strong>Singapore imposes an excise duty on all liquor, so expect to pay between $10 - $14 (~ $9 USD) for a small bottle of beer in restaurants or bars. Pro tip: Duty free stores inside the airport terminal are exempted from the liquor tax.</p>
<p><strong>9. MEDICATION RESTRICTIONS:</strong> Singapore has a strictly enforced no tolerance policy with respect to possession of illicit substances. Note that certain prescribed psychotropic medications (e.g. sleeping or anti-anxiety) may require you to apply for a license at least 10 days before your arrival.
