<p>This month we continued our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Open Science Demo Call</span></a> series by speaking to <a href="http://arokem.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Ariel Rokem</span></a>,  <a href="https://vistalab.stanford.edu/dora-hermes/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dora Hermes</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamara_Vanderwal"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Tammy Vanderwal</span></a> about three initiatives they’re involved with that promote openness in neuroimaging research.</p>
<p style="display: block">Ariel introduced us to <a href="http://nipy.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">NiPy</span></a>--short for NeuroImaging in Python--which is a large community-of-practice to support using python for neuroimaging. He explained that NiPy exists within the broader <a href="https://scipy.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">SciPy</span></a>--short for Scientific computing in Python--community, and it unites many individuals who use Python in their scientific analyses. As open communities, Ariel pointed out that anyone is welcome to use the NiPy and SciPy software as well as to participate in its development. If you’re interested in hearing more, he encourages you to <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/neuroimaging"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">check out the NiPy mailing list</span></a> or the <a href="https://conference.scipy.org/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">annual SciPy conference</span></a>!</p>
<p style="display: block">Dora told us about <a href="http://bit.ly/bids_ieeg"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">iEEG BIDS extension proposal</span></a>, a proposed extension to the BIDS standard for structuring human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data. She explained that to date, current challenges with iEEG data sharing include the large variability in both electrode locations as well as data formats across sites. The proposed extension will create a standardized structure to store iEEG data and metadata, allowing for novel, multi-model analyses via integration of iEEG with MRI, MEG and EEG. To contribute to the development of the iEEG BIDS extension, Dora encourages checking out the <a href="http://bit.ly/bids_ieeg"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">current draft</span></a> or commenting on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">BIDS mailing list</span></a>.</p>
<p>Tammy announced a new competition she is running with <a href="http://neuroguo.com/people/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Christine Cong Guo</span></a> entitled <a href="https://breakspear.github.io/moviesinthemagnet/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Movies in the Magnet</span></a>. Researchers from any career level are invited to submit novel analyses using movie-viewing data from the <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Healthy Brain Network dataset</span></a>, and the selected submission will be invited to speak at OHBM as part of the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2018/Symposia/Movies.pdf"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Movies in the Magnet symposium</span></a>. This competition highlights both the rich variability of naturalistic stimuli as well as the value of open data. <span style="font-weight: 700">Tammy and Christine encourage anyone interested to apply by Friday, May 25th!</span></p>
<p>Our next call will be on Thursday May 31st at 7pm BST (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180531T190000&amp;p1=tz_bst"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">check your local time zone</span></a>), where we’ll be looking ahead to the OHBM annual meeting in Singapore!
