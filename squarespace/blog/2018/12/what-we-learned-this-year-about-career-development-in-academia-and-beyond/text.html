However, this is what </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-r-bowles/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr Anita Bowles</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, the Head of Academic Research &amp; Learner Studies at Rosetta Stone in San Jose, California, had to say about her experience:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">“People often feel like a failure if they are thinking about leaving academia. I talk to a lot of graduate students in this situation and I understand their concerns, because I felt the same way. I would like to tell these students that this is not the case at all once you are on the other side of the decision. You can do valuable and satisfying things outside academia, including research that can be applied to help people. And if you feel like trying, just go for it.”</span></span></em></p>

We, however, found that our interviewees had varied approaches.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">“I found out about Rosetta Stone through networking: I knew someone else who was employed by the company and who also had moved from academia to industry. I am glad that it turned out this way for me, as what I am doing now has a lot of overlap with my past research, and I am passionate about this topic.”</span></span></em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">“As I was already passionate about open science and knew of the work DANS was doing, I was proactive and contacted them explaining my wish to gain experience outside academia. I was very lucky, as I indeed got the chance to work for DANS during a four months part-time internship in my final, fourth year of the PhD. The internship was the starting point of the job I have now, which DANS offered me after I finished my PhD.”</span></span></em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">“How did I start freelancing? In a way, it was also a lucky strike - I met a person in a bar who was leading a course on how to become a freelancer. I joined the course and got some practical instructions on how to start and find my own place in this space.”</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700"><font size="4">Every career path is different</font></span></span><br><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">No matter how much we try not to, we sometimes still compare our career trajectories with our peers. However, from </span><a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/sig-blog/2018/8/9/on-the-variability-in-career-paths"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr Aaron Clauset,</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder and in the BioFrontiers Institute, we learned that career trajectories in science are highly nonlinear. In his research Aaron and colleagues analyzed career paths of thousands of computer science professors at US and Canadian universities (</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/E9216.long"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Way et al., 2017</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, </span><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6324/477"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Clauset et al., 2017</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">). What they found was that the conventional research trajectory of a rapid rise in productivity to an early peak, followed by a slow decline, only emerges after averaging the individual trajectories of large groups of scientists. Even though the average number of papers per person per year is higher in highly prestigious institutions than in other institutions, the shape of this average trajectory is independent from the prestige of the affiliated institution. However, the average pattern conceals high inter-individual variability in the career trajectories to the extent that only one in every three faculty members follow the average trajectory (Fig. 1).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Furthermore, related work on citation to papers by physicists, carried out by Dr. Sinatra, one of Clauset’s collaborators and colleagues, revealed that groundbreaking discoveries seem to be equally likely at each career stage (Fig. 2, </span><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6312/aaf5239.long"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Sinatra et al., 2016</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The results from these studies are very optimistic - in a sense that there is not just one canonical way of pursuing a career in academia, and that success can come at every ‘academic age’.</span></span><br><span> </span><br><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700"><font size="4">Start your own institute!</font></span></span><br><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Lastly, what do you do when you know deep inside that you should pursue a career in research, but the whole universe tries to prove you otherwise? We interviewed </span><a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/sig-blog/2018/11/8/an-interview-with-jeff-hawkins-the-founder-of-redwood-neuroscience-institute-amp-numenta-inc-on-his-career-path-and-research-towards-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Jeff Hawkins</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, the founder of Redwood Neuroscience Institute &amp; Numenta Inc., who finished his official research training with a BSc from Cornell University in 1979. Since then, Jeff never successfully accomplished a PhD because of constant rejections of his ideas that were ahead of his time.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">So, Jeff developed an impressive career in mobile computing in the Silicon Valley instead, where he established Palm and Handspring, two mobile computing companies. However, his thoughts have always circled around science. Today, Jeff leads his own research institute, Redwood. Recently, he gave a keynote lecture at the Open Day of the prestigious Human Brain Project summit in Maastricht, where he introduced his theory of grid cells in neocortex (a.k.a. a Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence) as the framework for cortical computation. He is very modest about his achievements, and, when asked about how he managed to create his own institute, Jeff answered:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">“It was easier than you imagine. The idea came from several neuroscientist friends of my mine who said the field of neuroscience needs cortical theory. They encouraged me to start an institute. I agreed only on the condition that they help me, and they did. There were a number of scientists who, like me, wanted to work on cortical theory, so they signed up.”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Easy, right? :)</span></span></p>

We are going to launch an open initiative, where any OHBM member is welcome to help us shape a set of guidelines (in a  manuscript format) on effective self-management for early career researchers. We hope to meet you in this project!</span></span></p>
