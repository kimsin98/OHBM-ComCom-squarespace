There were also a few relatively large-scale MRI studies including 200-400 participants, some of which included sophisticated anatomical sequencing techniques. Most studies are done with collaborations worldwide, mostly with the US and European MR centers. Currently, there is no open-source database available in Israel, however, the neuroimaging data we acquire is usually uploaded to existing open-source databases (such as </span><a href="https://openneuro.org/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OpenNeuro</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">).”</span></span></p>

Researchers in Istanbul collaborate in EU funded (French) SME projects on biomarker development for Alzheimer’s Disease, ENIGMA projects, and with the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders. A challenge within Turkey is to encourage the national funding agencies to provide more financial support for large neuroimaging infrastructures - and there are plans to do so, to foster greater collaboration between Istanbul and NOROM in Ankara.</span></span></p>

Large-scale MRI studies will be conducted in this facility, but they are currently still in the planning phase. King Fahad Medical City also uses Magnetoencephalography (MEG) for clinical purposes.
