<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">This month we continued our </span><a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceDemoCalls"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Open Science Demo Call</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> series with a focus on this year’s OHBM annual meeting in Singapore, and the many ways that OHBM members promote open science at the meeting. We heard from </span><a href="https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/michele-veldsman"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Michele Veldsman</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayaka_Ando"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Ayaka Ando</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/akinikolaidis"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Aki Nikolaidis </span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">from the student and postdoc special interest group; </span><a href="http://gkiar.me/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Greg Kiar</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> and </span><a href="http://ilabs.washington.edu/postdoctoral-fellows/bio/i-labs-anisha-keshavan"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Anisha Keshevan</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> from the open science special interest group; and </span><a href="https://www.sites.google.com/site/nilsmuhlert/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Nils Muhlert</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> from the communications committee.</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">We first heard from Aki about the </span><a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/monday-night-social/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Monday Night Social</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, featuring beautiful views of the Singapore skyline and an announcement of the winners of this year’s </span><a href="http://www.neurobureau.org/brainart/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Brain Art competition</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">. All OHBM members are encouraged to attend! Ayaka gave us a sneak peak into this year’s career development symposium, </span><a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/annual-symposium/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">'The Secrets Behind Success'</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> with presentations from Tom Nichols and Lucina Uddin. Michelle told us about the </span><a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/mentoring-programme/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">mentorship program</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, which seeks to support professional growth at all career levels, from masters students to principal investigators. Although mentors and mentees meet at the OHBM annual meeting, you don’t have to be attending to get involved! Aki, Ayaka, and Michelle encourage everyone interested in any of these initiatives to stop by one of their events or </span><a href="https://twitter.com/OHBM_Trainees"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">reach out on twitter</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">!</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">Greg and Anisha then told us about this year’s </span><a href="https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2018/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">OHBM BrainHack and TrainTrack</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">. Formerly known as the OHBM hackathon, this is a collaborative event which brings together researchers and scientists from across the neuroimaging community to work together on projects, learn new skills, and engage with the community. While registration for the BrainHack and TrainTrack is sold out, the </span><a href="https://github.com/ohbm/OpenScienceRoom2018"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Open Science Room </span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">at OHBM will be hosting demos, workshops, and an open working space throughout the annual meeting. Greg and Anisha encourage everybody to come and find out about the great initiatives and individuals in our open science community!</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">Nils introduced us to the amazing work the communications committee is doing to spotlight open science at the meeting and throughout the year. They were involved in revamping the </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">OHBM website </span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">and </span><a href="http://ohbmbrainmappingblog.com"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">maintain a blog</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> highlighting initiatives within the OHBM community (including these demo calls!), as well as educational materials such as the </span><a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">OnDemand courses</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">. Nils pointed out that this provides a great way to stay involved year-round (e.g. </span><a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/5158/sections/7777"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">workshops on analysing diffusion MRI</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">), even for those who cannot attend the annual meeting. The communications committee also helps promote the excellent brain mapping work carried out </span><a href="human-brain-mapping-in-iran-talking-to-the-scientists.html"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">around the world</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, and provides a unique window into the stories of many successful neuroscientists through their </span><a href="../apps/search%3Fq=Keynote+series.html"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">keynote interview series</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">.
