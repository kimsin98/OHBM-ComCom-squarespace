<p style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As brain mappers start to log off their computers, comfortable in the knowledge that their OHBM 2018 abstract is finally submitted, we, at the OHBM Blog, offer a round-up of our most interesting and informative posts from 2017. This platter of self-citations should provide sustenance for those experiencing neuroscience hunger pangs throughout the holiday season. Each of our main contributors provides insight into their favourite posts - and if you feel you’d like to contribute as a guest blogger next year,</span><a href="mailto:ohbmblogteam@gmail.com"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)"> let us know</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">!</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As 2017 comes to an end, I think of the numerous ways that OHBM has promoted diversity since that first meeting in Paris, 22 years ago. I realized this while interviewing </span><a href="the-day-i-boarded-the-ohbm-time-machine.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Marsel Mesulam</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, a longstanding academic inspiration of mine and a founding member of OHBM. I found myself entranced by Marsel’s recap of the organization’s history. He touched on the themes of discovery, flexibility, and evolution in the field of human brain mapping, and the importance of taking a step back and drawing inspiration from the brilliant diversity that is OHBM – be it the various imaging modalities highlighted, the composition of OHBM’s membership, comprised of both </span><a href="ohbm-student-and-postdoc-sig-2017-who-they-are-and-what-they-do.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">trainee</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and established members, or multidisciplinary interactions such as the annual </span><a href="ohbm-2017-the-dream-catchers.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">art and neuroscience</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> exhibits. I truly believe that OHBM draws its strength from its inherent diversity, an ingredient necessary to advance the understanding of the organization of the human brain. I look forward to ushering in 2018 with the OHBM community.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">This year I met interesting people and learned interesting things through writing the blog posts. My favourites are: (1) the story of </span><a href="qa-with-mark-cohen-winner-of-the-2017-ohbm-education-in-neuroimaging-award.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">the first human fMRI experiment at the MGH</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (Mark Cohen interview); (2) finding out about </span><a href="qa-with-david-van-essen-winner-of-the-2017-ohbm-glass-brain-award.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">the future of data sharing</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> from David Van Essen; (3) the chaotic but </span><a href="dynamic-functional-connectivity-a-brief-overview-and-latest-thoughts-from-the-rotman-research-conference-on-neural-dynamics.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">pseudo-stable nature of brain connectivity</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">; and (4) how stimulating the lateral prefrontal cortex makes people </span><a href="qa-with-christian-ruff-ohbm-2017-keynote-series.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">comply more with social norms</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. As a PI, I find that all too often, PIs and trainees may get tunnel vision, being committed to certain research findings and to propagating certain theories. It is true that we all have to publish and propagate knowledge as researchers, but the reasons that we became researchers in the first place may be something different. From working on the OHBM blogs, I got a sense of history, of different perspectives, of how successful scientists can reinvent themselves and stay true to their passions. That experience was both humbling and energizing. As we look to the start of a new year, I ask you one question: “Sure, doing science can be tough, especially these days, but what would you rather be doing with your time and your brains?”</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I had a lot of fun interviewing </span><a href="ohbm2017-meet-the-leadership-alan-evans-council-chair.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Alan Evans</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> ahead of the annual OHBM meeting in Vancouver. However, my favorite post this year was not written by me, but by Agâh Karakuzu, a student of mine who wrote about his impressions as a first-timer at the OHBM </span><a href="ohbm-hackathon-2017-a-first-timers-perspective.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Hackathon</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. The pleasure came from guiding Agâh through the labyrinthine process of introductions, interviews, standard operating procedures and gruelling team edits, only to see his efforts validated by the overwhelmingly positive response from the community. I feel like the hackathon post provided exactly what the OHBM open science SIG needs -- easy entry points for the uninitiated. I hope this post will motivate other OHBM trainees to volunteer their time and energy, be it in making science more open, or in spreading the word about the exciting initiatives coming from OHBM in 2018.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Whilst I was mainly involved in editing this year (including setting up the gruelling team edits), I did get the chance to interview a number of the OHBM execs - finding out about the challenges of working as </span><a href="ohbm-2017-meet-the-leadership-michel-thiebaut-de-schotten-treasurer.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">treasurer </span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">and </span><a href="ohbm-as-a-society-qa-with-bernard-mazoyer.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">chair</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. But my personal favourite was interviewing the 2017 program chair </span><a href="ohbm-2017-meet-the-leadership-mike-greicius-program-chair.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Mike Greicius</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. His clinically-focused work covered such a wide breadth, from direct stimulation of the anterior cingulate in those with epilepsy to amyloid PET imaging in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Fleshing out the stories behind these papers and finding out his career path seemed to me to be exactly what we’re aiming for with our blog. Looking forward to our blogposts in 2018, you can expect more clinical neuroscience, open science, advice for early career researchers and coverage of brain mapping from around the globe.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My favorite experience of 2017 was surely the completion of my graduate studies and moving from the world of graduate student into a fully fledged PhD --- feels like I’m finally part of the cool kids club! A close second, though, was my </span><a href="an-interview-with-susan-bookheimer-neuroimager-feminist-and-horseback-rider.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Interview with Susan Bookheimer</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. Susan’s neuroimaging work at UCLA is fascinating and diverse, and her attitude and moral convictions are bold and impressive. It was refreshing to have a scientifically stimulating conversation with someone who shares such strong opinions on personal accomplishments, women in science, and the importance of life outside the PhD. </span></span>​</p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The end of this year marks my first year as a blog team member! Through the changing weathers, my work has changed colors, flourishing into an array of insightful posts on a variety of topics. It was fun liaising with the </span><a href="ohbm-2017-student-and-postdoc-sig-announces-mentorship-and-career-development-initiatives.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Student Postdoc SIG</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and writing for early career issues such as </span><a href="ohbm-student-postdoc-sig-mentoring-programme-qa-with-mentors-and-mentees.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">mentorship</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. But through all this, my favorite was to interview my postdoc advisor </span><a href="http://www.psy.miami.edu/bccl/people/luddin/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Lucina Uddin</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> as an </span><a href="ohbm-young-investigator-2017-lucina-uddin.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM Young Investigator Awardee</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">! It was enriching to see what makes a young investigator. I loved writing about things she is passionate about and sharing the pearls of wisdom that I, as her postdoc, have gleaned from her presence and mentorship. It was also inspirational to interview stalwarts such as </span><a href="qa-with-damien-fair-ohbm-2017-keynote-series.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Damien Fair</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, and see what a significant role mentorship has played in their careers.
