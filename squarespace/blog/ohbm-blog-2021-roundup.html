<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​While many of us hoped that 2021 would be back to “business as usual,” it instead offered a chance to re-evaluate our relationship to one another and to the larger systems we find ourselves in. The OHBM blog, too, often took a reflective tone, with posts on </span><a href="ohbm-committees-and-special-interest-groups-activities-an-end-of-the-year-update.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">the ongoing work from the brain mapping community</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> as well as the </span><a href="communication-committee-past-present-and-future-perspectives-on-science-communication-in-ohbm.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">past, present, and future</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> of how we communicate these efforts.

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​I joined the OHBM ComCom in 2020 during the pandemic, a very difficult time for everyone, and especially challenging for us in the developing world. But things are improving with vaccination. I have a role as the leader of the laymedia team where we work on science communication for the general public. This year I worked on a keynote blogpost for </span><a href="ohbm-2021-keynote-interview-series-qa-with-ted-satterthwaite-heterogeneity-is-the-key.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM 2021 keynote interview series</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and finished a post on Neuroimaging in Latin America where I highlighted the research from several groups across the region. I hope this new year brings more lay media articles to share with the world.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I joined the OHBM ComCom team this year and will lead as social media content editor for the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwMM4wEFi_hx2_6wVVoPBJA/featured"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM YouTube channel</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">.

Going forward, season 3 will be available with videos of the conversations between community leaders. We are also working on other formats and content to offer to the community online. While this is my main focus, I also contribute to the writing/editing of other communication pieces.</span></span></p>

I consider myself an avid podcast listener. Thus, I was very excited to get behind the scenes of making a podcast. I got a chance to edit some podcasts after joining the ComCom podcast team. The team is tasked with producing podcasts recorded by the esteemed Dr. Peter Bandettini. I usually listen to a podcast or an audiobook during my drive to the office. However, I have a very short commute and never get to listen to an entire podcast. Thus, being part of the podcast team allowed me to listen to podcasts for longer. They are very educational and personable at the same time. I am looking forward to working on more podcasts next year, in addition to doing some interviews.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Following a relocation from the UK to Canada in the midst of a pandemic, and the start of an exciting new academic chapter for me, this year I have decided to get involved with the OHBM ComCom team, to see what I can offer. It’s great to see the varied roles that ComCom is involved in. Already I have co-authored a blog post detailing how next year’s OHBM conference may go ahead in a ‘hybrid’ format. Next year I hope to continue my involvement with the blog team, help out with the OHBM YouTube channel as well as the Neurosalience podcast. It’s all still very new to me, but the rest of the team has been extremely welcoming, and I’m looking forward to being more involved next year.</span></span></p>

It’s been a joy working with this smart, dedicated team and seeing the podcast take off over the year. In addition, since I was also serving on the Technology Task Force to steer the 2021 virtual conference development, I contributed </span><a href="ohbm-aims-to-sparkle-at-its-2021-virtual-meeting.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">a post to our blog about the virtual platform selection process</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and what to look forward to at OHBM2021.
