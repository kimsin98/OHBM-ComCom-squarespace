<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">The OHBM  Diversity and Inclusivity Committee is exploring an exciting and new direction this year: we will be engaging kids in the scientific review process! We asked five prominent scientists in the field of brain mapping and neuroscience to write a short article explaining their research to kids. The articles are written for the Frontiers for Young Minds (</span><a href="https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkids.frontiersin.org%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cl.uddin%40miami.edu%7Cbb8aab342d864c805ad308d754aa3244%7C2a144b72f23942d48c0e6f0f17c48e33%7C0%7C0%7C637070962274410599&amp;sdata=Nu8kpkP9BA0tsAjii0xof2QX64lyyRVjUXCoHibBEY8%3D&amp;reserved=0"><span style="font-weight:400">https://kids.frontiersin.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, a journal dedicated to young readers of 8-15 years old. Once written, the articles are assigned to five young reviewers, who will work together with a neuroscientist mentor to critique the articles and prepare questions for the scientists. </span></font></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">During the virtual OHBM meeting, the five scientists will give a short presentation on their article. Following this, young reviewers will have 5-10 mins to grill the scientists with questions, based on the review they prepared with their mentors. Finally, the panel of young reviewers will decide whether to accept the paper or not. Thanks to the enthusiasm of our scientists, we have gathered five engaging topics: </span><a href="https://caitlinsmills.wixsite.com/acc-lab">Caitlin Mills</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"> will talk about the neural correlates of boredom, Tonya White will explain why some kids are more easily frustrated than others, </span><a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/dcns/about/faculty/girgis">Fady Girgis</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"> will walk us through the use of brain surgery to treat epileptic seizures, </span><a href="http://www.amanbadhwar.com/">AmanPreet Badhwar</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"> will present on biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease, while </span><a href="http://www.dnhi-lab.org/">Christoph Korn</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"> and </span><a href="https://dsnlab.org/">Gabriela Rosenblau</a><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"> will talk about social learning in adolescence. After the virtual meeting, all accepted papers will be published online in a joined OHBM-themed release of Frontiers for Young Minds. All articles will then be combined in the form of an e-book, with the common theme of brain mapping.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">Our goal with this activity is to communicate science to kids, develop their critical thinking ability, and nurture their inherent curiosity towards understanding the functions and anatomy of the human brain. Join the live review online and witness how Caitlin, Tonya, Fady, Aman, Gabriela and Christoph will handle the grilling by these critical kid reviewers!</span></font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#2a2a2a"><span style="font-weight:400">At last year's meeting in Rome, a drawing corner was provided where children in attendance could freely craft. Their art pieces were progressively displayed on a panel within the BrainArt exhibit (see figures below). For this special virtual edition of OHBM, we will be providing links to online resources that kids can explore and enjoy at home such as printable activities  (e.g., </span><a href="http://www.ellenjmchenry.com/homeschool-freedownloads/lifesciences-games/documents/Brainhat.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400">build your own brainhat</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">) and coloring sheets (e.g., </span><a href="http://www.beminders.org/colorthebe.html"><span style="font-weight:400">online coloring books</span></a></font><span style="font-weight:400"><font color="#2a2a2a">).</font> </span></p>

Free Educational Resources include: printable colouring pages, science experiments, and topics that combine science and art  (</span><a href="https://www.theremarkablz.com/freeresources"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">https://www.theremarkablz.com/freeresources</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">).</span></p>

<p><strong><font size="5" color="#515151">What’s next?</font></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#090808"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Diversity and Inclusivity Committee is committed to supporting all families within the OHBM Community. We strive to offer activities and spaces (however virtual) where parents and kids can develop a shared passion for science: no matter their age, language, or educational system.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font color="#090808"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we hope to engage them with our renewed collaboration with the Brain-Art SIG and adding the format of the live scientific review, but we wish for these initiatives to keep growing and diversifying as the Community they serve. To this end, we welcome comments and suggestions to ensure that any future OHBM annual meeting, whether online or in-person, will be a great experience for grown-ups as well as kids!</span></font></p>
