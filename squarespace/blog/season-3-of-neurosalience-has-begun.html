While it’s been around for over 20 years, only a fraction of papers reporting fMRI results have used this acquisition method. It can help quite a bit towards increasing sensitivity, mitigating signal dropout and motion artifacts, and stabilizing the time series to allow for tracking of very slow changes. Recent papers have come out showing that it significantly helps increase sensitivity and mitigate artifacts. In fact, several prominent leaders in the field are embracing it as they are convinced it's essential for increasing the reproducibility and, ultimately, the clinical utility of fMRI.  </span></span></p>
