While many throughout history have recorded dreams, at OHBM 2017 we were provided with the opportunity to view their tangible form in 3D representations of brain activity. This art and neuroscience initiative, entitled </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">Dream Sessions</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">, was undertaken by professional artist </span><a href="http://www.nathalieregard.com"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Nathalie Regard</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> in collaboration with neuroscientists </span><a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/group-roberto-toro/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Roberto Toro</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> and </span><a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/guillaume-dumas/"><span style="color:#1155cc; font-weight:400">Guillaume Dumas</span></a><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">. Creative pieces from </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">Dream Sessions</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> (both 80 Days in Dreams and 101Nights) were showcased at this year’s OHBM art exhibit, entitled “</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">Levels of Thought</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">”, along with artworks from other artists and neuroscientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Initiated in 2011, the ongoing goal of </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Dream Sessions</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> is to confront the subjective perception of Nathalie’s dreams with an objective, quantitative analysis through brain recordings. This journey to bridge the dream world with brain mapping required considerable effort, and had to overcome the challenges of being based in two different continents. Nathalie resides in Mexico City, while both Roberto and Guillaume are based in Paris. We caught up with Nathalie and Roberto at this year’s Art at OHBM initiative in Vancouver, Canada:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Nathalie Regard (NR):</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Hello, I am glad to introduce our new project which is kindly supported by Electrical Geodesics Inc. and </span><a href="http://www.neurobureau.org/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">The Neuro Bureau</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">.</span><a href="http://www.neurobureau.org/"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> </span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">This is a protocol that is half art and half science. My friends Roberto, Guillaume, and I are doing the piece 101Nights. For this project we’re recording EEG while I dream over a period of 101 nights.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">Ekaterina Dobryakova (ED):</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">What encouraged you to do this work, and how do you combine neuroscience and art?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">Roberto Toro (RT):</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> Nathalie has been keeping track of her dreams for more than 20 years, writing down every single dream as soon as she wakes up. She is now able to remember most of what she dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">With this project, we are creating a dialogue between what she does and what I do. In our first project she slept with an EEG headset for 80 nights, in continuity. I wrote a little program that played sounds – words, names of people she knows, etc. – at random times during the night. After she woke up we could read her dreams and find out if some of those words managed to enter into her dreams. Because we knew the exact time each word was played, we could get the part of the EEG signal corresponding to that part of her dream. After that, for each word that entered into Nathalie’s dreams, I did a laser cut bas relief confronting the EEG recording and the text corresponding to that part of the dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">I think the approach is interesting; it’s very different from my day-to-day activities in science, and offers me a different perspective on the data. For me, there is also a humble message: on the one hand there is such a rich subjective experience in someone’s dreams, with all those links to different aspects of what we are, and on the other hand, there’s so little that we can finally see in the data, even if we dig very deep into it. These bas-reliefs show us how far we are from reaching a true understanding of one individual’s subjective experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">NR: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">The protocol is to go to bed at night with a helmet of electrodes and try to fall asleep with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">​And during the night, audios with words are launched during the early REM phases of sleep, or randomly. Eventually the idea is for the audio to merge with the plot of my dream and mix with the stories. Each day I review if what I dreamt was related to the audio I received during the night. Roberto or Guillaume (who joined the project last year), then analyse the data to build these beautiful dream fossils of very dynamic moments during which many things happen --- projects and processes, stories and biographies, old memories mixing with new memories. For the 101Nights project I am also keeping track of what I do during the daytime: the people I meet, places I go, things I eat, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">ED: So what is it that motivated this type of work, and what is it that made you bring it to the science realm from the art realm?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">NR:</span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400"> We have worked with Roberto for many years, probably since 1995. We met in Valparaíso (Chile) and started working together for a mentor of Roberto, who was the head of the science faculty of the University of Valparaíso at that time. We discussed a beautiful book, the Theory of Colours (by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe). That was the beginning of this long conversation that continues to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">RT: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">We worked on many things with Nathalie. I started making a video of Nathalie when she was doing a big mural painting in front of the pacific ocean in Chile. Later on, I recorded videos and created time-flattened pictures of Nathalie while she was painting in Paris. 101Nights is one in a series of works that we have been doing together. I really value these exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">NR: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">Part of our collaboration comes from the ability of Roberto to build a chronology of things, something that he enjoys doing very much. This has been very nice for my work, which is often related to painting very large formats, or recording dreams for very long periods. Keeping a record of these processes would be very challenging for a video camera or a photographic machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">RT: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">That is interesting, as my neuroscience work focuses on the study of brain development and brain evolution, so basically I work on tracking weird stuff through time!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">NR: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">So we are made for each other (laughs).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:700">RT: </span><span style="color:#000000; font-weight:400">(laughs as well) So in addition to tracking brain development and brain evolution, I track the evolution of Nathalie’s art. I think I can add that to my CV!</span></p>
