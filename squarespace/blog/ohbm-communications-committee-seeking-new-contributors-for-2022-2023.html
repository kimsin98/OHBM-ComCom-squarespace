<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span>​</span></span></strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The primary mission of the OHBM Communications Committee (fondly known as ComCom) is to report on activities within OHBM to the organization’s members. We provide transparency on ongoing initiatives directed by Council or other committees and special interest groups (SIGs). ComCom further aims to highlight the achievements of the brain imaging community to the broader public through outreach activities.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​ComCom is composed of overlapping sub-teams that are each positioned to communicate information through different types of media. The major sub-teams are the Blog team (which provides regular updates on OHBM activities through </span><a href="../index.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">blog posts</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), Podcast team (responsible for the </span><a href="https://anchor.fm/ohbm"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Neurosalience podcast</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), and Lay Media team (responsible for public outreach). ComCom works closely with OHBM Council and liaises with other OHBM committees to produce content relevant to the wider OHBM community.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​</span></strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Individuals joining the committee start as contributors and can choose to work on one or more sub-teams. While contributors have no formal responsibilities, we may ask that they join in on specific projects as needed. This flexibility provides time for new contributors to explore the different aspects of ComCom and develop relevant skills. After contributing content (e.g., blog posts) for a year, contributors may be appointed as conventional ComCom members, should they decide to continue working with ComCom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As part of the committee, individuals typically contribute approximately 3–4 hours of work per month (such as drafting blog posts, reviewing content, and attending meetings). ComCom meetings are generally held once a month, with alternating time slots to accommodate our global team of contributors. Some sub-teams (e.g., lay media) may also choose to hold separate, additional meetings on an as-needed basis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">If joining ComCom sounds like a good fit for you, then consider applying to be a contributor via this <a href="https://ohbm-com.com/2022-applications/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">online application</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> </span></a>by 15 August (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20220816T000000&amp;p1=224&amp;p2=1440"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">5pm PDT</span></a>) As part of ComCom you will be the first to know about what’s happening within OHBM.
