<p class="sqsrte-text-color--accent">Overview of DIC committee 2023-2024 election procedure and results</p>
<p>The Diversity and Inclusivity Committee (DIC) at OHBM is dedicated to cultivating a diverse, engaged and inclusive international community of scientists conducting human brain research. To achieve this goal, DIC members collaborate to formulate a comprehensive plan to promote inclusivity across OHBM’s activities. The DIC’s approach involves investigating and implementing best practices suggested by current research on fostering inclusive environments. The committee develops new policies and programs aimed at creating a more inclusive environment, including leadership, education, and mentorship. These efforts are conducted in close collaboration with other OHBM committees and Special Interest Groups.  Comprising 9-15 members, including the Chair and Chair-Elect, the DIC plays a pivotal role in shaping OHBM’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity. In the autumn of 2023, the DIC conducted two significant elections to further advance its mission.</p>
<p>The first election took place from September 24th to October 2nd. Here, we were pleased to fill four positions for the roles of  graphic design officer, social media officer, and ad-hoc members for the 2023-2024 DIC term. We invited the OHBM public to apply for these positions. This opportunity attracted a remarkable response from our community, with a total of 55 applications submitted. These applications represented the rich spectrum of OHBM members, encompassing diverse backgrounds and career stages, ranging from graduate students to accomplished senior scientists. With the help of OHBM Executive Director, the 2022-2023 members of DIC voted on and elected our new members. <br>The second election took place from November 1st to 3rd, and the focus was on selecting a chair-elect from among two current DIC members. Election procedures, described in detail below, led to the identification of four exceptional new DIC members and our new chair-elect.<ul><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 700">2023-2024 DIC new members</span>: Joana Cabral (graphic design officer), Leyla Loued-Khenissi (ad-hoc member), Alyssa Pozzobon (ad-hoc member), and Jana Totzek (social media officer). </li><li style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 700">2023-2024 DIC Chair-elect</span>: Sharna Jamadar</li></ul><br><span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36)"><strong>Joana Cabral</strong> is a research scientist at the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute, University of Minho, Portugal. She is a Biomedical Engineer with a PhD in Computational Neuroscience and a postdoc in Psychiatry. She has developed several analysis and modeling algorithms to investigate the activity patterns detected with fMRI across conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36)"><strong>Leyla Loued-Khenissi</strong> is a Tunisian-American mother, cognitive neuroscientist and long-time brain mapper living and working on the shores of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. She currently holds a position as a postdoctoral fellow at the Lausanne University Hospital. Her areas of interest focus on fMRI, uncertainty and predictive coding.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36)"><strong>Alyssa Pozzobon</strong> is a PhD Student in Experimental Psychology with a focus in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada. She has worked in the field of sleep neuroscience and memory for over 5 years. Her current research looks at the micro-architecture of sleep dependent memory consolidation in older adults with dementia and cognitive impairments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36)"><strong>Jana Totzek</strong> is a Ph.D. student in Mental Health at McGill University's Department of Psychiatry. She earned her B.Sc. in Psychology from Maastricht University in 2020 and went on to complete her M.Sc. in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience at the same institution in 2022. As part of her M.Sc., she completed a research internship at the Douglas Research Centre in the CRISP group, where she is now pursuing her Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Martin Lepage and Dr. Katie M. Lavigne, focusing on psychosis, multimodal neuroimaging, and machine-learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36)">A/Prof <strong>Sharna Jamadar</strong> is a cognitive neuroscientist based at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She is broadly interested in how our life experiences confer resilience to the aging process. Sharna has developed a new approach to study brain connectivity on the basis of FDG-PET, called metabolic connectivity. She is also interested in parental neuroscience, and has proposed the novel hypothesis that parenthood contributes to cognitive reserve. She is a passionate advocate for diversity, inclusivity and accessibility in neuroscience.</span></p>
