<p class="sqsrte-text-color--accent">On behalf of the Women in OHBM Special Interest Group</p>
<p>Over half of OHBM conference attendees are women scientists (according to data from OHBM Executive Staff), and many of them continue to face gender-specific barriers in their work as human brain mappers. To enable members to learn from one another and mutually support career success, we created the Women in OHBM Special Interest Group (SIG), officially recognized as of March 2023.</p>
<p>The product of a 2-year informal consultation process, the Women in OHBM SIG was motivated by a group of mid- and early-career OHBM women scientists with shared interests and challenges around gender equity in terms of scientific impact, career development and work-life balance, among other topics. The SIG aims to provide a community for OHBM women to network, promote mutual career development and facilitate scientific exchange amongst women scientists.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 700">What we do</span><br>Motivated by our fellow OHBM members involved in the consultation process, as well as the ever-growing literature and awareness on the gender gap in academia (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24631" target="_blank">Casad et al., 2021</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-022-01072-2" target="_blank">Jebsen et al., 2022</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2020.101889" target="_blank">Keng, 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d43978-021-00037-2" target="_blank">Romano, 2021</a>), this SIG will augment the OHBM’s efforts in diversity and inclusion. We will set targets that will complement and strengthen the activities of the OHBM <a href="https://ohbm-dic.github.io/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Diversity and Inclusion Committee</span></a>, by promoting women’s achievements and providing networking events for women scientists. We will also complement the OHBM <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Student and Postdoc SIG</span></a> in enhancing mentorship for women members and taking mentorship to higher career stages.</p>
