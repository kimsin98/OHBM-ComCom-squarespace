<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">OHBM can negotiate better conditions with service providers as an organization than are available to individual OHBM members. The introduction of MEMBERSHIP+ highlights this potential: For an increased annual membership fee, OHBM members will gain access to discounted or improved services. In 2023 – as a trial year of MEMBERSHIP+ – this will be access to unlimited space on Dropbox, for which OHBM has negotiated a 50% discount on Dropbox memberships and will pass along the reduced fee via MEMBERSHIP+ without any profit for the society.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​Full access to MEMBERSHIP+ will cost an additional $144 USD, with 200 Dropbox licenses available - which is about $55 USD a year less than a subscription to the “Professional” Dropbox plan (</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/plans"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">$16.58 USD / month, annual subscription</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), offering 3 TB to individual users.

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">These changes to the membership follow a general trend over recent years in fostering the engagement of members outside the conference, such as the </span><a href="https://jobs.humanbrainmapping.org/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">career center</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and </span><a href="https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm#"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">on-demand educational videos</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In preparation for this post, I had a closer look at the global distribution of the members in the past 17 years, thanks to Beau and Beth in the Executive Office (see the analyses that reproduce these figures on </span><a href="https://github.com/ohbm-comcom/2023-blog-ohbm-membership"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">GitHub</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">/</span><a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ohbm-comcom/2023-blog-ohbm-membership/HEAD?labpath=Membership_Over_The_Years.ipynb"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Binder</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">). As mentioned earlier, the first thing that popped out to me is that the location of the conference is a major driver of membership numbers in that region. If we look at the panels in Fig. 1, we see that in years in which the conference was in North America or Europe, there are spikes in memberships for the corresponding regions.<br>​<br>The conference effect is most pronounced, however, for Oceania in 2008, when the annual meeting was held in Melbourne—the only time when there were more than 150 members from that region.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Somewhat surprisingly, the virtual conference mostly drew new members from North America (especially the US) and did not result in a more global audience. This is despite the efforts and emphasis of OHBM to be a global organization, ensuring </span><a href="best-practices-for-ensuring-diversity-of-presenters-at-ohbm.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">diversity and inclusivity</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. These efforts included providing platforms (in both </span><a href="a-guide-to-experiencing-the-virtual-ohbm-2020-annual-meeting.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">2020</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and </span><a href="ohbm-aims-to-sparkle-at-its-2021-virtual-meeting.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">2021</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">) that were globally accessible and using convenient time-zones, although they largely favored </span><a href="ohbm2022-plans-ohbm2021-survey-results.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">North America and Europe</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> in 2021 working hours. It is possible that multiple factors contributed to this imbalance, as </span><a href="the-future-of-focused-virtual-meetings-highlighting-the-2022-qmri-conference.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">recent specialized online conferences</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> seem to be more diverse. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As illustrated in Figure 3, the number of OHBM members has generally increased over the last 16 years. However, it is unclear whether this is an effect of the increasing benefits of OHBM membership or increasing popularity of human brain mapping research.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">While becoming a member of OHBM still seems to be largely connected to the annual conference, the organization has been focusing on connecting and engaging members year-round. These efforts are not only through benefits tied to the membership, but also through initiatives often launched by the Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which have a special focus on connecting and engaging members of OHBM within particular affinity groups. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In 2017 the </span><a href="ohbm-2017-student-and-postdoc-sig-announces-mentorship-and-career-development-initiatives.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">mentorship</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> program was launched by the Student and Postdoc SIG and is still </span><a href="mentorship-program-an-ongoing-initiative-by-the-ohbm-student-and-postdoc-special-interest-group.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">going strong</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, bringing together mentees and mentors from across the globe. (Indeed, this program was one reason for me becoming a member of OHBM in the first place!) Other initiatives include the </span><a href="ohbm-hackathon-2017-a-first-timers-perspective.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM hackathon</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, which started in 2012 and is now organized by the Open Science SIG.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Further efforts include special interest conferences, such as the </span><a href="the-future-of-focused-virtual-meetings-highlighting-the-2022-qmri-conference.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">recent virtual conference on qMRI in Neurodegeneration</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Moving the focus from the main conference and making OHBM engaging over the whole year has further benefits of inviting new members to join and be connected to the society, without the need to worry about visa restrictions, travel and accommodation costs, and might even reduce the </span><a href="how-can-human-brain-mappers-travel-more-sustainably.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">climate burden of traveling</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Being a member of OHBM has become increasingly attractive over the years, with more and more benefits and avenues of year-round engagement. The MEMBERSHIP+ subscription is another important step, offering additional incentives to become more engaged in the community. While the exact impact on membership numbers in the coming years remains to be seen, expect to see additional year-round features added to OHBM membership to benefit the society’s members and the society as a whole.</span></span></p>
