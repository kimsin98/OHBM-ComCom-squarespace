<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">OHBM leadership is interested in maximizing OHBM year-round. And so, it is critical to explore recent small virtual events to learn more about what these year-round virtual meetings could look like. One example of a successful virtual conference is the Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Neurodegeneration conference (</span><a href="https://qmriconference.wixsite.com/home"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">2022 qMRI Conference</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), which took place online from October 26–28, 2022. The conference highlighted the latest advances in quantitative MRI (qMRI) methodology and how these novel tools are being applied to study different neurodegenerative conditions. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Mallar Chakravarty, Dr. Christopher Rowley, Aurélie Bussy, and Olivier Parent about both their experience planning this kind of virtual event as well as what lessons they believe that OHBM can learn and apply to future focused and virtual endeavors. These are the key takeaways from our discussion:</span></span></p>

This conference not only provides an environment to establish new potential collaborations, but also offers the opportunity to listen to technical and application-oriented talks specific to qMRI. The conference paid special attention to trainees, encouraging them to give talks and submit qMRI-specific abstracts.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">What are the benefits of a focused conference?</span></span></strong><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">This platform allows for keynote-level exposure for researchers and trainees whose interest may not necessarily be highlighted at a larger conference. At a focused conference, their niche and special interests work can be put in the spotlight. The organizers enjoyed reaching out to the speakers and seeing their enthusiasm, but also greatly benefited by having internal discussions and thinking about the directions of their field. This type of focused conference not only benefits the attendees, but also the organizers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">​Sometimes, larger conferences are an easy place to get distracted. Focused conferences can complement that experience by inviting researchers from a specific area to network and showcase their research. The focused meeting format is a great way to answer and address open questions, especially those that require collaborative effort. This also allows researchers to focus on building connections between labs based on their research interests, which might not be possible at larger conferences or due to limited meeting opportunities. It is easier to foster these relationships with researchers that have similar questions and interests. <br>​</span></span><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span>The pros of an online platform for a virtual conference, generally, include international accessibility, low cost, control over recording and moderating, and the ability to host informal conversations and trainee talks. However, some of these pros can also become cons. The ability to moderate and control the conference on virtual platforms helps the talks to be short and targeted, but such restrictions on participant interaction may hinder social engagement within the audience and with the speakers. The qMRI conference organizers mitigated this challenge by designating moderators in the chat to interact with attendees and to ensure a smooth flow of conversation. However, while this may seem somewhat limiting, online platforms are more </span><a href="best-practices-for-ensuring-diversity-of-presenters-at-ohbm.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">inclusive</span></a><span> (and </span><a href="how-can-human-brain-mappers-travel-more-sustainably.html"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">sustainable</span></a><span>), as they can engage a larger international community and do not require travel funds or registration fees.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">How long does it take to organize a focused meeting?</span></span></strong><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The organizers suggested that the organization of the conference should take a little more than 6 months to plan, call for abstracts, and invite speakers. They cautioned future organizers to be mindful of other major conference deadlines, which can hinder planning and overlap with the deadlines of the event. After a great discussion with the organizers, a major question for future organizers of virtual conferences remains: what is the optimal number of days for a virtual conference to keep the maximum amount of engagement? A lesson that the organizers learned after this conference is that people’s online attention span is low and so keeping things short and targeted, and including several breaks is a great way to maintain engagement. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Lessons Learned from the qMRI Conference</span></span></strong><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">There is a lot to learn from the qMRI Conference! The organizers highlighted a few aspects of the conference that were very successful: sessions were only two hours long (each with four 30-minute talks), with a one and a half hour break in between, which kept the audience engaged over three days. Further, by obtaining external funding for advertisements, they were able to recruit a variety of very motivated trainees who particularly benefited from the open discussion periods and a new platform. Finally, the organizers overcame a large hurdle for online conferences by arranging the time-slots to be suitable for a global audience. The success of this strategy was confirmed by an after-conference survey and the attendance of approximately 500 international attendees - a very good retention rate for an online conference!</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The future of virtual conferences</span></span></strong><br><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The qMRI Conference is a great example for future meetings to learn from, and the takeaways from this discussion can be used to enhance virtual endeavors at OHBM. This conference also demonstrates the importance and relevance of focused events: Such events about niche interests not only help in building a strong, targeted community, and keeping this community developing and engaged, but also promote work that might not get the main attention at large conferences. While these meetings have a specialized target audience, they can also bring attention and interest to smaller research areas. In other words, these types of conferences are built for a specific community, but can also build a community. Utilizing OHBM’s platforms and variety of committees as a means to accessing these individuals is extremely powerful in building and maintaining niche communities. OHBM can expand its offerings with smaller pre-conference virtual meetings across the year, with the 2022 qMRI Conference being a great example of its utility and importance.</span></span></p>
