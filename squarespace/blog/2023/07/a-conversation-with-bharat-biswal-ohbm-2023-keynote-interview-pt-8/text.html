<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Bharat Biswal (BB):</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> I studied electrical engineering in India. Then I came to the US to complete my master’s in electrical engineering, specifically in signal processing. I was interested in a PhD, so a friend of mine who was there at that time said that I should go and meet this </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4238237/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">famous physicist Jim Hyde</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. So, I decided to do a PhD in medical imaging.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">RG: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">How difficult was it in those days to integrate into a foreign lab?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">BB: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Coming from India, it was a big culture shock in terms of food and so on. However, students are more open-minded. I never felt like a foreigner in the lab. We talked about science and about our struggles. My struggle was what I wanted to cook and eat, especially Indian food. I didn’t have as many options compared to now. I got to know about other cultures quite well. I had friends from France, Switzerland, and many countries. When I first landed at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, there was a lot of snow. Before my flight landed, I saw all of these swimming pools and thought so many people had swimming pools in their houses. The way they interact with snow in Bollywood movies was very different than the way it was when I saw snow. I would say I was very lucky.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">BB: </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When I wrote </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.1910340409"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">the resting state paper</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> there was a lot of criticism. Reviewers and others who had initially read the paper made the assumption that I was wrong. They could not pinpoint where I was wrong, but they thought that I was wrong. And that’s a very difficult situation to be in because you have to constantly prove that you’re not wrong. To this day, I still feel that some people think there is a mistake somewhere that I have made. That was the biggest challenge I faced in terms of my research. Other than that, I was in a very good lab and I had very good fellow graduate students. Many of them are now ‘who’s who’ in fMRI. I was very lucky to be in the right place at the right time when fMRI started.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">RG:</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> How did the idea of the functional connectivity paper come to you?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">BB:</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> I chose signal processing as my topic as a graduate student. I had read that if you do a specific task then the respiration rate changes a little bit. So, I thought maybe that was something I could also look at. Other people were looking at auditory tasks, motor tasks, etc. I thought if I could come up with a method that could help to understand the physiological sources, then this could better characterize the task. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In engineering, the best way to describe a system is to provide a random noise as the input. I thought that random noise could be something like a resting state. I would make the subject do certain tasks and also make them rest for about 7 minutes. Even when I removed the respiration and cardiac signal, I still saw that there was a large signal variation in the low frequency. Then, I wondered what would happen if I took a signal from the motor region and correlated it. During rest, I saw that the sensorimotor region was lighting up after correlation. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My colleagues thought it was very interesting and one of my mentors suggested that I should drop everything else I was doing and focus on this. This was my first experiment as a graduate student and my paper got rejected by 4 journals. It was painful as other students were publishing in high profile journals by doing motor tasks.</span></span></p>

There were also many others who have been very successful. Jim was a physicist by training, so my research was supported by him even when others said it couldn’t be true. He always supported me, and I was very lucky to be his student. He taught me that if you can do an experiment and replicate it, just write how the experiment was done—that is all that is needed.</span></span></p>

This is the time where you can take a lot of risks. Even if you make a big mistake, you are still learning and no one will fault you. This is a really good time to be in research. Everything is so accessible, but this also makes the field very competitive. After COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, people are starting to again get together and share ideas face-to-face. </span></span></p>
