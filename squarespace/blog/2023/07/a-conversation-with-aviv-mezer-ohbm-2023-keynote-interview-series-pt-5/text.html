<p style="display: block"><a href="https://elsc.huji.ac.il/people-directory/faculty-members/aviv-mezer/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr. Aviv Mezer</span></a> is an Associate Professor at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.</p>
<p style="display: block">Dr. Mezer’s lab is focused on mapping human brain structures during <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5932"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">normal development and aging.</span></a> In addition, it is focused on developing new approaches to characterize the structural changes associated with neurological disorders. Mezer’s main research tool is <em>in vivo</em> quantitative magnetic resonance imaging – qMRI. The Mezer lab is developing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11319-1"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">tools to biophysically explain the brain’s MRI signals</span></a> at different levels and resolutions: from molecular local sources through cellular organization to the mapping of networks across the entire brain.</p>
<p style="display: block">In this interview, we discuss the field of qMRI more broadly, touching upon the present and future interpretations of "<em>in vivo</em> histology." We also discuss Dr Mezer’s approach to mentorship, as well as the skills that would benefit future researchers in this field.<br>At <a href="https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2301/index.cfm?do=ev.viewEv&amp;ev=1705"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">OHBM 2023</span></a>, Dr. Mezer will show us how combining multiple quantitative MRI measures can provide additional biological information about tissue composition and brain health.  </p>
