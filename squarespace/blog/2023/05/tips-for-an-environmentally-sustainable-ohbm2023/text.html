<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">As we prepare for the <a href="https://ohbm-schedule-2023.my.canva.site/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">2023 annual meeting in Montreal</span></a>, many of us have started looking into travel arrangements, accommodation, and generally getting ready for the annual meeting. From booking travel to planning your time in Montreal, there are lots of ways that you can make your 2023 meeting experience more sustainable. Here we highlight some often overlooked tips, from getting around the city to poster printing and more</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">Travel to Montreal<br></span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">96% of a conference’s carbon emissions come from attendees flying to the meeting (</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40290-022-00421-3"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Gattrell et al., 2022</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">). Nevertheless, we value the opportunity to see each other and to network in person. An upcoming publication in Aperture Neuro (</span><a href="https://osf.io/6zysw"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Epp et al., preprint</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">), authored by the SEA-SIG, has investigated the carbon footprint of previous annual meetings and made suggestions for how we could change the meeting format to reduce our aviation emissions. This could include meeting in multiple locations rather than just one, and attendees travelling to their nearest ‘hub’. However, for the 2023 conference, OHBM will be meeting only in one location. In this post, we focus on how selecting particular flights can help reduce emissions, and how colleagues based closer to Montreal can travel to the city via more sustainable forms of transport.</span></span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><em><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Travelling to Montreal by plane <br></span></em><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Although all flights have a climate impact, some routes have higher emissions than others, depending on whether they are non-stop flights or occur at different times of day (i.e., when some planes will be more full and therefore more efficient). <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Google Flights</span></a> shows the carbon emissions of different flight and route options. Consider if you can save some carbon by selecting a particular journey, route, or time of day. It’s also important to fly economy, rather than business class. This is because the more people that fit on the flight, the fewer the planes that need to take off in order to transport the same number of people. This means economy seats are more efficient, carbon-wise, than business class seats.</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><em><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Travelling to Montreal by train<br></span></em><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking the train can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to an equivalent journey by plane (<a href="https://osf.io/6zysw"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Epp et al., preprint</span></a>). For those based within Canada or the Northeast United States, getting to Montreal by train within one day’s travel may well be feasible. It could also be more relaxed and enjoyable than a trip by plane, with the ability to work or socialise en route. You also get to enjoy the beautiful local scenery as you travel! The popular <a href="https://francais.amtrak.com/adirondack-train"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Amtrak NYC-Montreal route</span></a> runs through the scenic Hudson Valley, and will get you to Montreal in 10 hours - not much more time than flying, once you add in travel to and from airports and check-in time.</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">There's also now even more reason to take the train from within Canada, as VIA Rail Canada has partnered with the SEA-SIG to offer a 10% discount to conference attendees.</span></strong></p>

<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Montreal has very convenient public transport, operated by <a href="https://www.stm.info/en"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Société de transport de Montréal</span></a> (STM). The STM metro and buses are a great way to get around the city. The conference center is located next to <span style="font-weight:700">Place-d'Armes</span> metro on the Orange line and is also walkable (8-10 mins) from <span style="font-weight:700">Place des Arts</span> metro on the Green line. The transport fares are listed <a href="https://www.stm.info/sites/default/files/pdf/en/tarifs.pdf"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a>. If you are there for the entire conference we recommend getting the weekly pass which also includes airport bus fare. Note that the weekly pass is valid from Monday! SEA-SIG is working on a bulk discount for conference attendees. If you are interested in receiving an STM public transport discount via SEA-SIG, please <a href="https://forms.gle/KuGvZCav6J1ytA2g8"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">express interest on this form</span></a>.<br></span>​</p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Montreal also has a bike-share system called <a href="https://bixi.com/en"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Bixi</span></a>.

Bixi stations are located all around the city so you should never have far to go to find one. If you are planning to use Bixi bikes regularly during OHBM, we recommend the $20 for 30 days option, as this will be cheaper than multiple one-way passes.<br></span>​</p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight:700">Hotels and accommodation<br></span>Hotel stays can have a <a href="https://earth911.com/travel-living/green-hotel-stay-5-ways/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">significant environmental impact</span></a>, from the frequent laundry of towels and sheets, to energy-hungry air conditioning.

<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight:700">Poster printing<br></span>Colleagues often tell us that they are worried about the environmental impact of printing posters. In the grand scheme of things, compared to flying to conferences—or even the energy consumption of our neuroimaging analyses—this is small. Nevertheless, we recommend that poster presenters:</span><ul><li><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Print on paper, rather than ‘fabric’: the ‘fabric’ used for posters is actually plastic, and cannot be recycled, which a paper poster can (although some ingenious presenters have <a href="https://blogs.egu.eu/geolog/2016/08/19/geotalk-recycle-textile-posters-into-useful-products/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">‘upcycled’ their polyester ‘fabric’ posters into bags</span></a> and even <a href="https://veronikach.com/life-hacks/how-to-recycle-your-fabric-poster-faq/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">clothing</span></a> for a second life)Ask your print facility if they use recycled paper—and if not, why notDesign your poster to avoid using large blocks of colour, which will require significantly more ink.

<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight:700">Catering and eating out<br></span>One of the many activities we enjoy at OHBM is socialising over food and drinks. When purchasing food, consider choosing plant-based options, and reducing consumption of animal products. Livestock farming has a significant environmental impact, from carbon emissions to water usage and biodiversity damage. In fact, eating a primarily plant-based diet can save 1 whole tonne of carbon over a year (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Wynes &amp; Nicholas, 2017</span></a>). </span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">To help attendees find vegan- and vegetarian-friendly places to eat, SEA-SIG has created a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZL8oXnwbTcVzF29E8"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">GoogleMap of cafes and restaurants near the conference center</span></a> that are either entirely vegan and vegetarian, or have strong plant-based offerings. We have also included on the map some sustainability-themed visitor attractions, such as the <a href="https://espacepourlavie.ca/biosphere"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Biosphere Environment Museum</span></a> and Mont Royal Park.</span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Although these actions may seem small, it is important to recognise the effect that our lifestyle choices have on wider society, via the shifting of social norms (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128221075430"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Rae et al., 2022</span></a>). So talking to others at the conference about the ways in which you are choosing to have a more sustainable meeting will likely have an even greater impact than the actions themselves.</span></p>
