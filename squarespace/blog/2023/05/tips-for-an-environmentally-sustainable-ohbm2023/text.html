<p>As we prepare for the <a href="https://ohbm-schedule-2023.my.canva.site/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">2023 annual meeting in Montreal</span></a>, many of us have started looking into travel arrangements, accommodation, and generally getting ready for the annual meeting. From booking travel to planning your time in Montreal, there are lots of ways that you can make your 2023 meeting experience more sustainable. Here we highlight some often overlooked tips, from getting around the city to poster printing and more</p>
<p style="display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">Travel to Montreal</span><br>96% of a conference’s carbon emissions come from attendees flying to the meeting (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40290-022-00421-3"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Gattrell et al., 2022</span></a>). Nevertheless, we value the opportunity to see each other and to network in person. An upcoming publication in Aperture Neuro (<a href="https://osf.io/6zysw"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Epp et al., preprint</span></a>), authored by the SEA-SIG, has investigated the carbon footprint of previous annual meetings and made suggestions for how we could change the meeting format to reduce our aviation emissions. This could include meeting in multiple locations rather than just one, and attendees travelling to their nearest ‘hub’. However, for the 2023 conference, OHBM will be meeting only in one location. In this post, we focus on how selecting particular flights can help reduce emissions, and how colleagues based closer to Montreal can travel to the city via more sustainable forms of transport.</p>
<p style="display: block"><em>Travelling to Montreal by plane </em><br>Although all flights have a climate impact, some routes have higher emissions than others, depending on whether they are non-stop flights or occur at different times of day (i.e., when some planes will be more full and therefore more efficient). <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Google Flights</span></a> shows the carbon emissions of different flight and route options. Consider if you can save some carbon by selecting a particular journey, route, or time of day. It’s also important to fly economy, rather than business class. This is because the more people that fit on the flight, the fewer the planes that need to take off in order to transport the same number of people. This means economy seats are more efficient, carbon-wise, than business class seats.</p>
<p style="display: block"><em>Travelling to Montreal by train</em><br>Taking the train can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to an equivalent journey by plane (<a href="https://osf.io/6zysw"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Epp et al., preprint</span></a>). For those based within Canada or the Northeast United States, getting to Montreal by train within one day’s travel may well be feasible. It could also be more relaxed and enjoyable than a trip by plane, with the ability to work or socialise en route. You also get to enjoy the beautiful local scenery as you travel! The popular <a href="https://francais.amtrak.com/adirondack-train"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Amtrak NYC-Montreal route</span></a> runs through the scenic Hudson Valley, and will get you to Montreal in 10 hours - not much more time than flying, once you add in travel to and from airports and check-in time.</p>
<p style="display: block"><strong>There's also now even more reason to take the train from within Canada, as VIA Rail Canada has partnered with the SEA-SIG to offer a 10% discount to conference attendees.</strong></p>
<p style="display: block">VIA Rail will take 10% off the cost of roundtrip fares to Montreal when booked via the<a href="https://www.viarail.ca/en"> <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">VIA Rail Canada</span></a> website. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>VALID:</p>
<p>July 19th 2023 to July 30th 2023</p>
<p>TERRITORY:</p>
<p>From all stations throughout the VIA system to Montreal, Quebec and return.</p>
<p>RESTRICTIONS:</p>
<p>Fare applies to a maximum of two passengers per booking. One complimentary stopover is allowed at no additional charge. For travel on all fare plans in Business class, the first stopover is allowed at no additional charge, provided that this stopover takes place in Toronto, Montréal or Ottawa only.</p>

<p>To use this offer, you will need to enter a discount code. This will be distributed via the next OHBMonthly newsletter. To receive the 10% discount code, you can also contact <a href="mailto:ohbm.sea.sig@gmail.com"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">ohbm.sea.sig@gmail.com</span></a>, or DM us on Twitter @OhbmEnvironment.</p>
<p style="display: block"><em>Carpooling</em><br>Another possible mode of travel for those in Canada or the Northeast USA is carpooling. If you drive to Montreal with colleagues, this can save carbon relative to everyone taking a flight, especially if travelling in an electric vehicle. The more people that carpool with you, the lower the carbon emissions per person.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 700">Getting around the city</span></p>
<p style="display: block">Montreal has very convenient public transport, operated by <a href="https://www.stm.info/en"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Société de transport de Montréal</span></a> (STM). The STM metro and buses are a great way to get around the city. The conference center is located next to <span style="font-weight: 700">Place-d'Armes</span> metro on the Orange line and is also walkable (8-10 mins) from <span style="font-weight: 700">Place des Arts</span> metro on the Green line. The transport fares are listed <a href="https://www.stm.info/sites/default/files/pdf/en/tarifs.pdf"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a>. If you are there for the entire conference we recommend getting the weekly pass which also includes airport bus fare. Note that the weekly pass is valid from Monday! SEA-SIG is working on a bulk discount for conference attendees. If you are interested in receiving an STM public transport discount via SEA-SIG, please <a href="https://forms.gle/KuGvZCav6J1ytA2g8"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">express interest on this form</span></a>.</p>
<p style="display: block">Montreal also has a bike-share system called <a href="https://bixi.com/en"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Bixi</span></a>. There are even electric bikes available for when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Royal"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Mont Royal</span></a> looks like a little too much of a challenge. Bixi stations are located all around the city so you should never have far to go to find one. If you are planning to use Bixi bikes regularly during OHBM, we recommend the $20 for 30 days option, as this will be cheaper than multiple one-way passes.</p>
<p style="display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">Hotels and accommodation</span><br>Hotel stays can have a <a href="https://earth911.com/travel-living/green-hotel-stay-5-ways/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">significant environmental impact</span></a>, from the frequent laundry of towels and sheets, to energy-hungry air conditioning. You can reduce these impacts by:</p>
<ul><li>Placing the ‘do not disturb’ sign on your door to indicate that housekeeping should not replace towels and sheets every day, or telling the front desk that you wish to reuse your sheets and towels</li><li>If the room has air conditioning, using this only when in the room, and if needed</li><li>Switching off appliances not in use</li></ul>
<p style="display: block">Staying in AirBnB or rental apartments instead of hotels can also help reduce your accommodation footprint, as you can control the resources being used! However, holiday rental apartments can have significant negative effects on local communities. Quebec is actually in the process of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-airbnb-legislation-1.6838625"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">changing their regulations around AirBnBs</span></a>, significantly restricting them. Note that all legal AirBnBs will have a CITQ number, and this should be confirmed when booking.</p>
<p style="display: block"><a href="https://www.google.com/travel/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Google Travel</span></a> has ‘eco-certified’ badges for accommodation options with a lower environmental footprint, or membership of sustainable hotel accreditation schemes.</p>
<p style="display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">Poster printing</span><br>Colleagues often tell us that they are worried about the environmental impact of printing posters. In the grand scheme of things, compared to flying to conferences—or even the energy consumption of our neuroimaging analyses—this is small. Nevertheless, we recommend that poster presenters:</p>
<ul><li>Print on paper, rather than ‘fabric’: the ‘fabric’ used for posters is actually plastic, and cannot be recycled, which a paper poster can (although some ingenious presenters have <a href="https://blogs.egu.eu/geolog/2016/08/19/geotalk-recycle-textile-posters-into-useful-products/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">‘upcycled’ their polyester ‘fabric’ posters into bags</span></a> and even <a href="https://veronikach.com/life-hacks/how-to-recycle-your-fabric-poster-faq/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">clothing</span></a> for a second life)</li><li>Ask your print facility if they use recycled paper—and if not, why not</li><li>Design your poster to avoid using large blocks of colour, which will require significantly more ink. A white background is best rather than coloured backgrounds</li></ul>
<p style="display: block">Some poster print facilities near the conference center are:</p>

<p style="display: block"><span style="font-weight: 700">Catering and eating out</span><br>One of the many activities we enjoy at OHBM is socialising over food and drinks. When purchasing food, consider choosing plant-based options, and reducing consumption of animal products. Livestock farming has a significant environmental impact, from carbon emissions to water usage and biodiversity damage. In fact, eating a primarily plant-based diet can save 1 whole tonne of carbon over a year (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Wynes &amp; Nicholas, 2017</span></a>). </p>
<p style="display: block">To help attendees find vegan- and vegetarian-friendly places to eat, SEA-SIG has created a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZL8oXnwbTcVzF29E8"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">GoogleMap of cafes and restaurants near the conference center</span></a> that are either entirely vegan and vegetarian, or have strong plant-based offerings. We have also included on the map some sustainability-themed visitor attractions, such as the <a href="https://espacepourlavie.ca/biosphere"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Biosphere Environment Museum</span></a> and Mont Royal Park.</p>
<p style="display: block">Although these actions may seem small, it is important to recognise the effect that our lifestyle choices have on wider society, via the shifting of social norms (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128221075430"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Rae et al., 2022</span></a>). So talking to others at the conference about the ways in which you are choosing to have a more sustainable meeting will likely have an even greater impact than the actions themselves.</p>
