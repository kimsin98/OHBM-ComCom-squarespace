<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In this interview, we discuss the pioneering work of </span><a href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/research"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr. Jacobs and her group</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> in leveraging brain imaging, computation, and endocrine approaches to deepen our understanding of the influence of sex hormones on the central nervous system across spatial and temporal scales. Her group uses structural and functional neuroimaging methods to explore how the brain changes in response to endogenous hormonal changes, such as across the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or menopause, as well as to exogenous hormones via oral hormonal contraceptives. Through the Ann S. Bowers Women’s Health Initiative, Dr. Jacobs and her group are working towards creating a population-level brain imaging dataset to advance our understanding of women’s brain health across the lifespan.  </span></span></p>
<p style="display:block;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dr. Jacobs also shares her journey into neuroscience research, her thoughts on how science can inform public policy, and talks about her groups’ efforts to improve girls’ representation in STEM by partnering with K-12 groups. This work was featured in the book </span><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/steminists-the-lifework-of-12-women-scientists-and-engineers-curie-osity-project/6453538?ean=9781942001782"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">STEMinists: The Lifework of 12 Women Scientists and Engineers</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">. </span></span></p>
