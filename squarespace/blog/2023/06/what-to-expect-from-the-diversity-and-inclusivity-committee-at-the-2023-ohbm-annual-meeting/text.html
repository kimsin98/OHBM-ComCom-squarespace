<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The <a href="https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2301/index.cfm?do=ev.viewEv&amp;ev=1530" target="_blank">DIC Symposium is back</a> for the 5th year in a row! This year we will highlight how advances in technology can be leveraged to enhance diversity and inclusivity. We have assembled an excellent panel of speakers who bring their expertise in technological solutions for increasing accessibility for individuals with visual and auditory impairment (Natalina Martiniello and Tilak Ratnanather), solutions for improving inclusivity in neuroimaging studies that involve the collection of EEG data (Jasmine Kwasa and Arnelle Etienne), and mobile neuroimaging technologies for imaging of remote and rural populations (Parisa Zakavi). </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In this series of kid-friendly events, we invite young reviewers (ages 8–15) from all over the world to critically evaluate scientific findings presented by researchers in the OHBM community. This year’s events involve more languages than ever before! Starting with one language in the first edition, we now have children speaking 12 languages, including Bengali, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Marathi, Portuguese, and Spanish.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> <br>This year, there are two streams of events: online and in-person. Prior to a given event, these young reviewers first watch a presentation prepared by the neuroscientists in their native language (with subtitles in English). On the day of the event, they can question the researchers directly, along with their classmates and teachers at school, or siblings and parents at home. The majority of events are already happening online throughout May and June in different parts of the world. The final event will take place </span><a href="https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2301/index.cfm?do=ev.viewEv&amp;ev=1663"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">live in Montreal at our annual meeting</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (<strong>Tuesday, July 25, at 12 pm, Room 511</strong>) .
