<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Happy New Year and welcome to 2023, the year that OHBM will travel to Montréal for the 29th Annual Meeting. This meeting will be primarily held in person—but in a change from previous years, </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:700">all </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">members of OHBM can upload approved content and automatically have access to Annual Meeting content in a virtual space, regardless of registration status. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In previous years, presenters were required to register for the Annual Meeting prior to uploading their content. New this year, presenters who are unable to participate in person may upload content simply by being a member of OHBM. This shift will reduce the financial burden for individuals who cannot travel to Montréal. Membership can be renewed </span><a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/ams/amslogin.cfm"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">here</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> at any time. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span>We have renewed o</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">ur partnership with Fourwaves to host the virtual portion of the cutting-edge scientific programming for which OHBM is known.

Fourwaves will allow your work to be previewed and celebrated, but there will be no mandatory virtual presentation times. After the abstracts have been pre-loaded onto Fourwaves, authors will be invited to upload their poster PDFs to the platform. Optional poster highlights videos will be encouraged as well. Members will be able to review abstracts before, during, and after the Annual Meeting. </span></span></p>

As with the accepted abstracts, summaries of all presentations will be pre-loaded onto Fourwaves and authors will be asked to upload a pre-recorded video of their presentation. Unlike the poster PDFs, this pre-recorded video will be REQUIRED and the deadline to place it on Fourwaves is June 30, 2023. </span></span></p>
