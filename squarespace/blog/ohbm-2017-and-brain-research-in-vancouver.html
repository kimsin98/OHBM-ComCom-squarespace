<p><span><font color="#000000">By now, you’ve heard that the 2017 OHBM Annual Meeting will be held in picturesque Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). Nestled between mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Vancouver is home to a vibrant and dedicated community of neuroscience researchers and brain health clinicians. Vancouver is a diverse, accessible city (equidistant from Europe and Asia and bordering the United States), offering ample opportunity for networking and interaction with some of North America’s leading neuroscientists. With researchers located across the province, from the </font><a href="http://www.uvic.ca/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">University of Victoria</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (UVic), to </span><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Simon Fraser University</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> (SFU), to the Vancouver and Okanagan campuses of the </span><a href="https://www.ubc.ca/"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">University of British Columbia</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">, neuroscience research in BC is collaborative, well funded, and world-renowned.</span></span></p>
