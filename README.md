## Transferring a post

1. Open the original blog page and the matching folder in [squarespace](squarespace).
2. Copy title.
3. Add images as necessary.
4. Insert code blocks around images and copy HTML from `text.html`.
5. Compare with the original and make changes if necessary.
   You may need to create additional text/code/other blocks and edit manually.
6. Open settings (click on date above title). Set the post Status (under Options) to "Needs Review".

## Reviewing a post

1. Text: Check spaces/line breaks, general formatting feel.
2. Image: Check that all images are present.
3. If everything looks good, open settings (click on date above title).
   * Content > Post URL: Match the original URL (`blog/name`).
   * Options > Status: Set "Published". Change the date to original date in the past. Time can be whatever.
4. If you can (admins only), create a [basic author](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518)
   and change the author.

## Formatting notes

* Title: Default heading and font, no changes
* Main Text Size: Paragraph 2 (default)
* Image captions text size: Paragraph 3
* No indentation on paragraphs, just new line (this doesn't necessarily need to be consistent across sections)
* Change URL from random character string to name of the article

## TODO

- [x] Organize by date
- [ ] Aggregate [basic authors](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518)
- [ ] Tags, categories?
