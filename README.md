# OHBM-ComCom-squarespace

## Protocol for transferring a page

1. Copy title.
2. Add images as necessary. Image files are all in the
   [www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/uploads](https://github.com/kimsin98/OHBM-ComCom-squarespace/tree/main/www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/uploads)
   directory.
3. Create code blocks between images and copy HTML from corresponding files in [squarespace](squarespace) directory.
4. If possible, change the author to the right [basic author](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518).
5. Review, publish, change the URL, and
   [change the date](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543597-Changing-blog-post-publication-dates)
   to original publication date.

## Formatting notes

* Title: Default heading and font, no changes
* Main Text Size: Paragraph 2 (default)
* Image captions text size: Paragraph 3
* No indentation on paragraphs, just new line (this doesn't necessarily need to be consistent across sections)
* Change URL from random character string to name of the article

## TODO

[ ] Aggregate [basic authors](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518)
[ ] Tags, categories?
