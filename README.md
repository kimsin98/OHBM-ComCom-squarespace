## Protocol for transferring a page

1. Open the original blog page and the matching folder in [squarespace](squarespace).
2. Copy title.
3. Add images as necessary.
4. Insert code blocks around images (or caption) and copy HTML from `text.html`.
5. Compare with the original and make changes if necessary.
6. Publish. Change the URL and [date](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543597-Changing-blog-post-publication-dates)
   to match the original.
7. If you can (admin), change the author to the right [basic author](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518).


## Formatting notes

* Title: Default heading and font, no changes
* Main Text Size: Paragraph 2 (default)
* Image captions text size: Paragraph 3
* No indentation on paragraphs, just new line (this doesn't necessarily need to be consistent across sections)
* Change URL from random character string to name of the article

## TODO

- [x] Organize by date
- [ ] Aggregate [basic authors](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518)
- [ ] Tags, categories?
