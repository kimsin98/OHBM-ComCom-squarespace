## Protocol for transferring a page

1. Find the folder matching page URL in [squarespace](squarespace).
2. Copy title.
3. Add images as necessary. Insert code blocks between images and copy HTML from `text.html`.
4. If you can, change the author to the right [basic author](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518).
5. Review, publish, change the URL, and
   [change the date](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543597-Changing-blog-post-publication-dates)
   to original publication date.

## Formatting notes

* Title: Default heading and font, no changes
* Main Text Size: Paragraph 2 (default)
* Image captions text size: Paragraph 3
* No indentation on paragraphs, just new line (this doesn't necessarily need to be consistent across sections)
* Change URL from random character string to name of the article

## TODO

- [x] Organize by date
- [ ] Aggregate [basic authors](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205810518)
- [ ] Tags, categories?
